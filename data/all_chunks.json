Shooting enemies while standing on fire or ice will burn or freeze them, respectively. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Friend to Gun and Bullet: If the player has Potion of Gun Friendship (Potion of Gun Friendship) , while it is active, a copy of the player's current gun appears and automatically fires at nearby enemies. ** The copy of the held gun fires faster than normal but with reduced damage, especially if it is a rifle-style weapon. ** This synergy affects the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) while playing Winchester's mini-game, and the shots fired by the copy do not count against the player's allowed tries. ** Before the A Farewell To Arms (A Farewell to Arms Update) Update, If the player drops Potion of Gun Friendship while the synergy is active, the copy gun is permanent. This can be done repeatedly to amass a large amount of orbiting guns. ** This synergy works even if the weapon used is out of ammo. ** This is best utilized with weapons such as the Dueling Laser (Dueling Laser) , which will fire multiple shots in succession without needing to recharge. *** The copy gun carries over to the Past. ** The copy gun can reveal secret rooms (unless it is an infinite ammo weapon or another kind of weapon that cannot normally reveal secret rooms). ** The copy gun fires all types of the guns bullets at once (e.g. fires all three levels of Polaris (Polaris) at once). * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Greener Guon Stone: If the player also has Green Guon Stone (Green Guon Stone) , the stone's chance to heal the player is raised to 70% if the player is one hit from dying and 20 also appears whenever Green Guon Stone heals the player. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Nailed It!: If the player has Nail Gun (Nail Gun) , its nails deal triple damage. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Oranger Guon Stone: If the player also has Orange Guon Stone (Orange Guon Stone) , it shoots twice as fast and deals 8 damage rather than 5. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Pinker Guon Stone: If the player also has Pink Guon Stone (Pink Guon Stone) , enemies that damage the player become temporarily charmed. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Pistol Machine: If the player has Machine Pistol (Machine Pistol) , its shots pierce enemies and are connected with electricity. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Redder Guon Stone: If the player also has Red Guon Stone (Red Guon Stone) , the player gains a yellow glow and stat increase similar to that of the Macho Brace (Macho Brace) for a short time whenever the Guon Stone blocks a bullet. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Reinforced: If the player has Lower Case r (Lower Case r) , the voiceline and burst will spell BULLET+1 when fired. * the +1 Bullets has a synergy called Whiter Guon Stone: If the player also has White Guon Stone (White Guon Stone) , Daruma (Daruma) 's recharge is halved. However, Daruma itself is not part of the synergy. * In addition to their unique effects, all -er Guon Stone synergies increase the size of the Guon Stone and make it rotate at a fixed distance from the player while they are moving instead of on a slight delay. * If duplicates of this item are somehow obtained, further increases the damage of the player's bullets.",

For example, a +1 sword would add one bonus damage and have one better chance to hit on attack rolls, thus being \"1 better than (a) normal\" sword. The flavor text supports this, \"+1 To Bullet\" as opposed to \"+1 to hit\" or \"+1 to damage\". In previous versions of Dungeons and Dragons, a well-crafted but non-magical weapon was called a Masterwork weapon, giving further evidence to this reference through the item description. This is even further supported by the fact that Guon Stones, all of which other than glass share a synergy with +1 Bullets, are a reference to , a type of item from the very same game. * The description may also be a reference to a famous scene in Spinal Tap, where one of the characters, Nigel, proudly showcases an amplifier that \"goes to 11\", under the impression that it is \"1 louder\", similar to how +1 Bullets are \"1 better\".",

The last sentence of the Ammonomicon is a reference to older versions of Counter-Strike, where if you switched to another weapon and back to the sniper rifle after firing, you would be able to skip the bolt animation and zooming and therefore be able to fire again quicker. The name AWP and tagline \"Noob Cannon\" also refer to Counter-Strike's AWP, popular among new and experienced players alike for its ability to one-shot opposing players. The line \"banned in certain sectors\" is a reference to the fact that the AWP is often banned in certain public Counter-Strike servers due to its overuse and perceived lack of balance. The synergy is a reference to Metal Gear Solid's character. The synergy changes the sprite of the A.W.P to the Asiimov, an A.W.P skin available in Counter-Strike 2 (previously Counter-Strike: Global Offensive). The white camouflage itself is a reference to the real life Accuracy International Arctic Warfare sniper rifle (wikipedia:Accuracy International Arctic Warfare) .

    "text": "Title: AC-15\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nIf the player has Gunknight Armor (Gunknight Armor) , it causes an unknown effect. The gun's old pickup quote, \"Metalled Gear\", is a reference to the Metal Gear (wikipedia:Metal Gear) series. The gun's name and pickup quote are a reference to the Armor Class (AC) system, used since the 1st Edition of Dungeons & Dragons to denote characters' defensive capabilities. Wearing armor would increase the AC, making a character harder to hit, which is why armor increases the gun's power. The gun's description of an \"unintuitive system\" refers to the THAC0 (To Hit Armor Class 0) system used in 2nd Edition, which gave numbers to each character class that they would have to roll on a die to hit an armor class of 0, reducing the \"to hit\" number if the AC was greater than zero, and raising the \"to hit\" number if the AC was less than zero. The system was complex, which led to later editions having players roll dice against the AC value itself, rather than using the THAC0 number. The unused synergy also refers to Dungeons & Dragons, in which Constitution is one of the core six \" \" stats whose value applies bonuses or penalties to various values and rolls, such as hit points. More specifically, it refers to an ability check — a d20 roll whose result is modified by an ability score (Constitution in this case) and must exceed a certain result for the check to succeed. If the player has no armor and opens a chest containing the AC-15, it will briefly take on its upgraded appearance before changing to its normal form. The gun's synergy with Void Core Assault Rifle (Void Core Assault Rifle) may be a reference to the Armored Core series of videogames. AC-15 shines while the player is armored. Lich's Eye Bullets (Lich's Eye Bullets) will cause the AC-15 to always be in the powered up form due to the synergy.",

His Ammonomicon image and character sprite are also similar to those of the Shadow Magician, but with a change to the color palette. This possibly relates to the Ammonomicon entry stating that the Shadow Magician is \"controlled by an unseen master\" and how Agunim is said to still exist within the Gungeon, attempting to escape. If so, the Shadow Magician could be a puppet being used by him to aid with his plan. The Shadow Magician is even referred to as \"shadow_agunim\" in the game files. Agunim is a reference to Agahnim from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (wikipedia:The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past) . The similarity to the Shadow Magician is also a reference to , as you fight copies of Agahnim multiple times throughout the game. It may also be a reference to the nightmare version of Agahnim from . Even with the Galactic Medal of Valor (Galactic Medal of Valor) , it will take three orbs to kill Agunim. This is probably because the orbs are not an attack done by the player, but by Agunim himself. shows that Agunim is the Sell Creep (Sell Creep) . With this in mind, it seems the R&G Dept.

In the boss encounter screen from the R&G Dept. (R&G Dept.) , it says \"Cam Clarke as... Agunim\". Cam Clarke is the voice actor for Liquid Snake, and the battle in the R&G Dept. (R&G Dept.) is a reference to the Hind D battle in . His quotes when you defeat him are a reference to the lines Liquid Snake says in . Agunim in opening of the R&G Dept. (R&G Dept.) seems to be wearing a red loincloth. The phrase: \" \" could be a reference to the 1985 movie in which the main character, Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, says: \" \" In the \" \" update trailer, Agunim's face in his helicopter appears with a spoiler censor mark. As of the \" \" update, according to his introductory phrase in the Bullet's past, Agunim is the only boss within the Gungeon who does not serve the Lich (Lich) , and is hoping for his master (Cannon) to usurp the Gungeon throne and enslave all bullet kind as his minions. The phrase \" \" is most likely a reference to a glitch where the game can't figure out what the player was killed by and the death screen says \"Killed By Your own slow reflexes.\" The phrases and , said when the player is killed by him on R&G Dept., gives the impression that Agunim will use the player to resurrect his master, Cannon (Cannon) .

Four guns do not appear in the Ammonomicon (and this list): the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) , used in Winchester's (Winchester (NPC)) game; the Mimic Gun (Mimic Gun) , which can rarely replace any gun and must be used until the player picks up ammo or does enough damage; the High Dragunfire (High Dragunfire) , found only in a special Secret Room (Secret Rooms) ; and the Windgunner (Windgunner) , which can be temporarily used when Sprun (Sprun) transforms. All guns, after emptying a clip, will have to reload, which takes a short time, varying with the gun. This time can be reduced (Reload Speed Boosts) , or entirely negated by the synergy, If a gun is left unequipped for double the time of its normal reload, it will passively reload. If the player is too close to a wall and is facing it directly, the gun will not be able to shoot. This prevents loss of ammo by accident in cases which bullets wouldn't hit any enemies by any chance. If left on the ground, guns will be stolen by the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) . If the player has the Ring of the Resourceful Rat (Ring of the Resourceful Rat) , guns can be traded for a similar-powered (Quality) item, while having the synergy removes the stealing entirely. There are currently 243 guns in the game total, including 191 base game guns, 15 guns that were added in the update, 15 guns that were added in the update, and 22 guns that were added in update.",

Arrowkin are an unevolved species of Bullet Kin, and also a reference to the first species of men to roam the earth, mainly because of their clothing and resemblance to Neanderthals, hence the facial expression.

The movie's villain, the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, uses the titular Golden Gun as his weapon of choice and boasts of only needing one shot per target. \"Some Assembly Required\" refers to the fact that in the film, the Golden Gun is assembled from a series of golden innocuous looking items: a fountain pen (the barrel), a cigarette lighter (breech), cuff-link (trigger), and a cigarette case (the grip). The flavor text is a reference to the James Bond game GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64 (and subsequent James Bond games) where it was unique in that it instantly killed anything hit by its shot. is the for gold. The 22 ammo count is likely a reference to 22 karat gold known as \"Crown Gold\". The exception to this is the Pilot (the Pilot) whose bonus increases the gun's ammo by 10% to 24, which would reference 24 karat or \"Pure Gold\".  It may be tied to the flavor text.  \"It doesn't live up to the legends, but it comes close\" - The gun in the movie was 23 carat gold. The synergy is a reference to the famous quote from The Thing, a superhero from the Fantastic Four group that belongs to the Marvel Universe.",

Interacts strangely with Double Vision (Double Vision) - Instead of doubling the backwards shots, a player that activates Double Vision with Backup Gun equipped will fire three shots forwards, and one shot backwards. With Backup Gun, Dark Marker (Dark Marker) 's charged shot's accuracy is decreased, which can cause it to fail as the two projectiles have a chance to miss each other. Negates the recoil of the Mutation (Mutation) and the Grasschopper (Grasschopper) . Synergizes extremely well with weapons that can bounce shots on walls or release homing projectiles such as The Scrambler (The Scrambler) , the Bee Hive (Bee Hive) or the Moonscraper (Moonscraper) . Works well with Orbital Bullets (Orbital Bullets) , as shots fired backwards which would normally miss will instead orbit the player.

If the player also has Corsair (Corsair) , movement speed is increased, the damage of both guns is doubled, and their bullets travel 20% faster. While popped (empty due to taking damage while held), the Balloon Gun has no sprite, effectively making it invisible. If the Balloon Gun is emptied by using up its ammo reserve instead of taking damage, the gun remains un-popped and can be dropped and retrieved like any other. If the player drops (not throws) the Balloon Gun on the ground while it is popped, its lack of sprite makes retrieving it difficult, but not impossible. However, if the player throws (Guns) the Balloon Gun while it is popped, the gun will disappear, making retrieving it impossible. Despite appearing invisible, the Balloon Gun can be sold to the Sell Creep (Sell Creep) while it is popped. Munchers (Muncher) will not accept a popped Balloon Gun, only one (partially) filled with ammo. Refilling the gun with ammo allows the player to feed the Balloon Gun to a Muncher.

The small lasers are fast and precise, and can throw you off if you are dodging the slower rings.

It is technically possible to simply run away from the missiles, as they explode after some time, but this can put you in dangerous situations and is generally not recommended.

For instance, a blank triggered by Blank Bullets while holding the Gold Ammolet (Gold Ammolet) causes the damaging radius of the blank to affect entire rooms. This phenomenon can also be seen in the mini-blanks generated by Houston (Clown Mask) , the Owl (Owl) , and Ser Junkan's (Ser Junkan) Holy Knight form. ** Blank Bullets combined with Gold Ammolet can clear rooms without entering them. Other Ammolets can inflict status effects on enemies before entering the room, but the effect will not progress until the room is entered. * Every projectile fired by the player has a chance to trigger the effect. As such, shotgun type weapons and guns like the Bullet (Bullet) or Shell (Shell) will very frequently trigger the blank effect. * The beam damage multiplier granted by Blank Bullets does not stack with the beam damage multipliers of Shock Rounds (Shock Rounds) , Flak Bullets (Flak Bullets) , Explosive Rounds (Explosive Rounds) , Shadow Bullets (Shadow Bullets) , Vorpal Bullets (Vorpal Bullets) , Katana Bullets (Katana Bullets) , Devolver Rounds (Devolver Rounds) or Hungry Bullets (Hungry Bullets) . * If the player has Gold Junk (Gold Junk) and Ser Junkan (Ser Junkan) , every shot from the mech's chain gun will trigger a blank. * The blank effect can open secret rooms, even with an infinite ammo starter weapon or nails launched by Casey (Casey) with the the Blank Bullets has a synergy called Careful Iteration|-: synergy. ** When a blank triggers, it reveals secret rooms anywhere in the current room, regardless of whether it is within the blank's radius. * The chance to fire a blank bullet increases with slow-firing weapons, and decreases with fast-firing weapons. ** Despite this, fast firing weapons are generally still vastly superior at triggering the blank effect. For example, the Vulcan Cannon (Vulcan Cannon) can reliably trigger the effect every second and sometimes several times per second. * Beam weapons cannot trigger blanks. ** Weapons that pierce also cannot trigger blanks unless they hit a wall * Projectiles created by passive items such as Roll Bomb (Roll Bomb) can also trigger blanks. * This cannot activate the Blank Shrine (Shrines) to spawn a chest, likely because the player could use them to create an infinite number of chests otherwise. * If duplicates of this item are somehow obtained, increases the chance of the bullet-blank effect and allows the item to activate more than once on a bullet.",

If the player has M16 (M16) , the companion will occasionally trigger a blank upon shooting the last bullet in a magazine of the M16. This \"blank trigger\" shares the same internal 10-second cooldown that the actual ring has. That is to say, if your M16 triggers a blank upon shooting the last bullet, and then you use an active item within the next 10 seconds, the blanking effect won't work with the active item on top of that. If the player has Teapot (Teapot) , the companion will gain his own AOE attack of the same size upon reload of the weapon.

    "text": "Title: Blasphemy\nSection: Tricks\n\nTricks\nThe hitbox of Blasphemy's swing extends slightly behind the player, allowing it to hit an enemy that is very closely behind the player by swinging forward. The reload for Blasphemy only destroys bullets at the very start of the animation, even if the weapon is still up. Running into bullets while \"reloading\" will not destroy bullets. Blasphemy can shoot its beam through thin walls by swinging while standing directly next to a wall and facing it. However, this only works with very narrow vertical walls. If you swing and then immediately dodge roll, the swing will move forward with you, allowing you to slice through thicker walls of bullets or reach a farther away enemy. A “guard flash” that hits nearly all enemies on screen regardless of distance or obstacles can be performed by swinging in the opposite direction of the enemies, then instantly double-tap “reloading” and quickly turning to face the enemies. This does not reveal secret rooms. This technique is possible, albeit difficult, to do on controller. An easier way to perform a guard flash on controller is to map your reload button to the left bumper or trigger. This makes Blasphemy essentially a more powerful Camera (Camera) with slightly lower fire rate, as the Camera only does 10 damage while Blasphemy does 14. Quickswitching between Blasphemy and a secondary weapon in between guard flashes can cancel Blasphemy's reload time. Although this is a bit trickier, it allows its users to perform a faster guard flash. The guard flash also gains the benefits of the double-tap reload, pushing back enemies and destroying nearby bullets. Guard flash can be performed with a normal reload, but it is very precise and difficult to do correctly. A guard flash can be performed while aiming at the enemy as long as you turn fast, so it is possible to hit an enemy with both the sword beam and guard flash. This technique becomes easiest on controller with the left bumper/trigger reload and if you do a spin after the shoot and reload. A counterclockwise rotation is recommended as it's easier for your thumb. In versions prior to v2.1.4 (v2.1.4) , while using the carrot skin for Blasphemy, every sword swipe to the left functions as a guard flash without needing to perform one. If you are using Super Hot Watch (Super Hot Watch) and you halt your movement after the initial swing, you will be able to take your time while performing the guard flash. Guard flashing is a completely intended mechanic and is not a bug whatsoever.",

Bored with the afterlife, he occasionally roams the shifting halls of the Gungeon as a spirit of recreational vengeance.\n\nis a secret boss (Bosses) found in the Black Powder Mine (Black Powder Mine) . He is Manuel's old partner from when they entered the Gungeon seeking the Gun that Can Kill The Past. Blockner betrayed Manuel and killed him, transforming him into a ghost. In order to get to Blockner, the player must find the secret room in the Hall of Knowledge (Hall of Knowledge) and pick up Old Knight's Helm (Old Knight's Helm) and Old Knight's Shield (Old Knight's Shield) . After defeating Ser Manuel, if spoken to, he will inform the player of Blockner. Blockner will then appear in the Black Powder Mine (Black Powder Mine) , along with two Gun Nut (Gun Nut) s as bodyguards. After defeating Blockner, he will show up (in ghost form) in The Breach (The Breach) as an NPC (NPCs) . Speaking to Ser Manuel (Ser Manuel) in the Hall of Knowledge (Hall of Knowledge) unlocks Betrayer's Shield (Betrayer's Shield) and Badge (Badge) . If Blockner is defeated for the first time (not as a ghost) and is defeated flawlessly, he will drop a Master Round (Master Round) for that chamber. If the main boss of the chamber is also defeated flawlessly, it will not drop another master round. The same applies in reverse. Once defeated, Blockner's ghost can appear in the Gungeon as a mini-boss, similar to the Shadow Magician (Shadow Magician) . Upon death, he will drop several pickups.",

    "text": "Title: Blockner\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nSer Manuel (Ser Manuel) has a line where he mentions the moments after being killed by Blockner. He says he was inside a chest and from that moment on, he was a ghost. This might be a reference to coop chests that revive players, meaning that the dead player becomes a ghost after their death, and the chest has to be opened by their ally to come back to the physical plane. Since Manuel had to get out by himself, he remains as a ghost. The reasons for Blockner being a ghost and not respawning are unknown. His name being \"Blockner\" is likely a pun on his affinity with shields, as a shield is used to *block* blows. If properly timed and the player is wielding Casey (Casey) , Blockner's ghost can be killed almost immediately by his own shield attack.  The player must hit him with a fully charged strike immediately as his shields begin to divide across the room; doing so will parry most of them into him before they have a chance to disperse. The same thing can happen when using the Finished Gun (Finished Gun) . He is very skeptical about Manuel's dodge roll technique, believing that it shouldn't work and using shields as an alternative way of defense. This could be a reference to the Dark Souls video game series.",

Pressing the dodge button teleports the player a short distance in the direction they are moving. This can be used as a pseudo-dodge roll for players using controllers. The distance traveled is about the same as a dodge roll, but a timing adjustment is needed. The regular timing for dodge rolling will not work, because unlike regular dodge rolls, the player is invincible until the trigger is released Holding down the dodge button allows the player to teleport to the location of the cursor, shown by a shadow of the player's character. With a controller, the shadow gets created at the player's current position, and is controlled by the right analog stick (so any aiming will displace the teleport target). If the player attempts to blink into a solid object or off a ledge, the shadow will turn red, and the player will be teleported as far as safely possible in that direction. This safety also exists for flying players. This also means that if the flying player is already over a pit, then unless there is solid ground in range. This also prevents the player from blinking onto rails that run over pits in Black Powder Mine (Black Powder Mine) , and blinking onto the spine bridge that appears after defeating the Dragun (Dragun) . Blinking onto bullets will cause them to dissipate, and they won't cause damage. Decreases reload times by 30%.",

Technically, you can enter the room, but you won't be able to see anything without using a blank outside of the secret room. Blanking inside the secret room will not reveal it. Can be used to rescue NPCs (NPCs) before acquiring the Cell Key (Pickups#Cell Keys) by teleporting into their cell. The player can teleport through the two walls that access the entrance to the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) 's lair,not being able to see anything but still able to use the Gnawed Key (Gnawed Key) to open the entrance. Can be used to teleport behind Wallmonger (Wallmonger) , out of reach of the boss's attacks. However, the camera will remained locked on to the Wallmonger. Repeatedly teleporting in place can effectively grant immunity to bullets. When using the Bloodied Scarf in The Aimless Void (The Aimless Void) , the player will dodge roll normally instead of teleporting.

The teleport is still considered a dodge roll despite having replaced the action, so teleporting can still fail challenges  issued by the Gunsling King and Manservantes (Gunsling King and Manservantes) to clear rooms without dodge rolling. The teleport can be used to reach normally inaccessible areas present in certain layouts of Winchester (NPC) (Winchester (NPC)) 's games and improve the vantage point, and the player will not be penalised for doing so.",

This will cause you to be stuck behind the locked door, and you won't be able to die or deal any damage to enemies inside it. The only way to escape is with the dead player killing the enemies with their mini-blanks. By teleporting onto the edge of the Shop (Shop) 's counter, it is possible to walk behind the counter to where the shopkeeper is standing. This has no effect, and the player can walk out normally. Teleporting out of an elevator as the doors close to go to the next level causes the game to bug, taking you to a random room and preventing you from controlling your character. Attempting to teleport to a forbidden area and then teleporting using the map can cause the game's camera to attempt to move back to the area you tried to teleport to initially, until you try teleporting elsewhere again. Teleporting out of boss rooms is possible if done correctly. During the fight against the Dragun (Dragun) , it is possible to teleport into the long corridor leading to the room. In there, you can still shoot at the Dragun, but it will not take damage, even from projectiles reaching it. Teleporting through The Gorgun (The Gorgun) 's petrification wave will still result in being petrified. Teleporting through the cascade of shells after the Dragun (Dragun) fight will prevent the player from properly transitioning to the Aimless Void (The Gungeon) . The player will be stuck in the small area behind the cascade until they pass the cascade again, from above or below. Teleporting close to a chest after defeating all enemies with Drill will cause the chest to disappear and soft lock the game. Teleporting into a blocked-off room in the Resourceful Rat's Lair (Resourceful Rat's Lair) can result in a softlock.

Defeating a boss allows the player to advance to the next main floor. Upon being killed, bosses drop a weapon or item of random quality, several Hegemony Credits (Pickups#Hegemony Credits) , and one to three pickups such as hearts, ammo, or keys. Bosses will always drop a gun if the player has not yet picked up a gun on the current floor. This can seemingly be worked around by throwing an empty gun using the Fire button and picking it back up; which could be useful if you want \" \" instead of \" \", but are out of keys to open any chests in the floor, and out of money to purchase any guns in the shops. Dropping and then picking up guns with the \"Drop Gun\" button instead doesn't seem to work for this purpose, instead probably still guaranteeing a gun if you haven't gotten an actual new gun in the floor in any other way. If a boss from one of the five main floors is defeated without getting hit, they will drop a Master Round (Master Round) as well. Clearing a boss without getting hit will also cause it to drop doubled Hegemony Credits.",

The DPS cap is applied across a 3-second window. The most damage a single shot can deal is equal to triple the floor's DPS cap. In Boss Rush (Boss Rush) , bosses have no damage per second cap.

Because the gun's fire rate is slower than its reload time, the gun cannot be charged immediately after it is reloaded. Similar to other guns with a magazine size of 1 (e.g. Stinger (Stinger) ), dropping the gun and picking it back up will instantly reload it and reset the fire rate delay, allowing it to be charged immediately.

Upon death, the Bullet Bishop does not correctly become a corpse, instead simply becoming enraged and shaking back and forth. This may be a remnant of a more complicated death sequence that was never finished. The dead Bishop no longer deals contact damage, but does not have it's hitbox disabled either, meaning the player cannot walk through it, rendering it an impassable barrier. If the dead Bishop has not yet triggered it's boss introduction, entering a room with the dead Bishop will still cause the boss splash screen to appear. The Bullet Bishop is one of the few unused enemies with an Ammonomicon entry. The Bullet Bishop's boss intro card uses the bosscard of the HM Absolution (HS Absolution) as a placeholder. The Bishop does not have animations for walking. In fact, sprites of him walking are not even present in the files. This suggests that the Bishop was intended to be a stationary boss, and that it's behaviour of drifting towards the player is merely a consequence of being built off the Template Boss (Template Boss) . The Bishop does however have an unused animation for teleporting in a cloud of incense. While the Bishop likely was not intended to walk, teleporting may have been his main method of navigating his boss room. The Bishop also has an unused animation called 'summon'. It is unknown what he would have summoned. He most likely would have summoned cardinals (Bullet Kin) as he is accompanied by 2 of them as seen on the steam page",

Do not let him back you into a corner, for most of his patterns are extremely tight at first, but offer generous openings as they advance further — thus, the farther away you are from him, the more easily you can dodge his attacks. If he is starting to push you very close to a wall, concentrate on getting to the open side of the room before resuming fire. Because the large burst bullet attack always starts going up, you should make an effort to not cross above him or risk being forced to blank. If the chancellor takes damage, he will charge right at you. He is easy to kill, but may be hard to spot when you're focusing on dodging bullets. Either deliberately take him out or make sure you don't accidentally hit him. The large bullet that splits into many can be destroyed with Blasphemy (Blasphemy) to skip the attack and prevent it from splitting. The fire flask can be deflected away from the player by shooting it in midair. It will still ignite the ground where it lands.",

At this point, the chancellor will be instantly killed upon taking any damage or touching the player. The chancellor has a chance to drop upon death, even after the fight ends. The Chancellor can be charmed, but his attacks do no damage to the King. Failing to kill the Chancellor will result in them reappearing on the following floor with that floor's boss, with a sword in their hands instead of their regular staff. This carries across runs: if you fail to reach a boss on the following floor, or restart that exact run where you left him alive, you can encounter a floor one boss with a Chancellor. This means that the Gatling Gull (Gatling Gull) and the Trigger Twins (Trigger Twins) can have a Chancellor by their side, and Bullet King can also gain a second Chancellor, resulting in two of them during his fight. The Chancellor, at this point, will charge at you regardless of if he's shot or not, also holding a sword. The Chancellor can generate as a Jammed. If the Chancellor is hit with Casey (Casey) from about a Casey's length away, the Chancellor's body will deal a large amount of damage to the boss it hits, killing Bullet King and other bosses in one hit. Bullet King is immune to goop, and cannot be set on fire. When Bullet King dies, his throne may block access to pickups. The throne can be destroyed by shooting it. If Bullet King dies right next to or on top of the item pedestal spawn point, the throne will explode automatically as if the player had destroyed it. If Bullet King dies right next to the entrance or exit of the boss room, the throne will not explode automatically, but will explode if the player shoots it in order to leave the room. If Bullet King dies right next to or on top of the Chancellor, the Chancellor will be glitched inside the throne and cannot be killed unless the throne has been destroyed.

    "text": "Title: Casey\nSection: Notes\n\nNotes\nWith Armor of Thorns (Armor of Thorns) , Shotgun Full of Hate (Shotgun Full of Hate) , Nail Gun (Nail Gun) , or Eyepatch (Eyepatch) , Casey fires a spread of 6 nails when swung, and takes on a spiked appearance. When an enemy is hit with Casey, they will become dark red and take damage over time. This also changes the sound effect of \"readying\" Casey. This change seems to be affected by Scattershot (Scattershot) causing the new sound effect to multiply. Casey's charged swing launches you forward a bit. Be mindful near pits to avoid falling. Mechanically, Casey's charged swing fires an invisible short-ranged projectile. This projectile can be made visible with modifiers such as Cursed Bullets (Cursed Bullets) , and can even be spawned by certain items, such as Hip Holster (Hip Holster) or Orbital Bullets (Orbital Bullets) . Casey bullets spawned this way do not reflect enemy bullets, however. Reflected bullets are affected by the player's bullet modifiers - Homing Bullets (Homing Bullets) will give deflected bullets a chance to home in on enemies, Shock Rounds (Shock Rounds) will cause deflected bullets to become electrified, and so on. Ghost Bullets (Ghost Bullets) are an exception to this, as reflected bullets do not pierce through enemies. If combined with Flak Bullets (Flak Bullets) , Casey will shoot three high damage pellets, making Casey more functional as a long range weapon. These bullets also retain Casey's \"launch upon death\" property. Casey can deflect the High Dragun's (High Dragun) rocket attack, but the deflected rocket will not deal damage. Most explosive enemies killed with Casey will have their explosion delayed, preventing unavoidable damage. This does not apply to explosive barrels or Challenge Mode (Challenge Mode) 's \"Explosive Pyre\" modifier. The Laser Sight (Laser Sight) does not appear when holding Casey. Casey can reflect the Killithid's (Killithid) bullet portals. If the Bullet King (Bullet King) or Old King (Old King) ’s Chancellor is launched into a boss, the Chancellor’s body will deal a large amount of damage to the boss it hits, killing both Bullet King and Old King in one hit. This does not work if the chancellor is jammed. This also works on most other bosses if you have spared the Chancellor, as sparing him can cause him to appear in other boss rooms. If Casey reflects a Spirat (Bullat) while the enemy is in projectile form, it will teleport back towards the direction of the player at an elevated velocity equal to the speed it was reflected. Although Casey is a D tier item, it is much better than other D tiers, with huge destructive potential with an enemy that shoots enough bullets. On top of this, it can clear out bullets similar to Blasphemy (Blasphemy) , making it very good for maneuverability. This suggests Casey might need an upgrade in its quality level.",

    "text": "Title: Casey\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nThis weapon is a reference to Ernest Thayer's 1888 poem Casey at the Bat (Wikipedia:Casey at the Bat) . This weapon is also a reference to the Casey Bat from , also named after the poem. The quote \"Nothing can happen until you swing the bat.\" is from FLCL (Wikipedia:FLCL) . The tagline “Batting .50” is a reference to .50 caliber bullets and Batting Average (wikipedia:Batting_average_(baseball)) in baseball (a theoretical 0.500 being impossibly good). The top half of the bat is a shotgun shell casing, making its name a pun. The fact that the weapon increases curse (curse) while being carried stems from the Gungeon rejecting melee weapons. This gun is among those Gunsling King and Manservantes (Gunsling King and Manservantes) can challenge the player to clear a room with. Usually, opening a chest containing Casey causes it to appear on the right side of the chest, instead of the center. Whenever the player finishes a round with a super punch in the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) 's Punch-Out!! phase, he will swing Casey at the player. Even if the player has Casey, The Rat will still use it and the player will be unable to. The synergy is likely a reference to Steve's bat from Stranger Things. It should be known that it could also be a reference to Negan from The Walking Dead. Also try using Casey with Katana Bullets (Katana Bullets) , it’s surprisingly amazing.",

    "text": "Title: Challenge Mode\nSection: Notes\n\nNotes\nShortcuts are blocked off if challenge mode is active. Wall Mimics can be affected by Long Live the King before being activated, preventing any other enemies from taking damage until the Wall Mimic is found. Upon entering a room, time will briefly slow to show the room's modifiers. Trap rooms (rooms that contain no enemies) won't have modifiers, regardless of what floor they appear at. This is due to the modifiers only activating in rooms with enemies. If enemies spawn into a previously empty room by using Lament Configurum (Lament Configurum) , the Drill (Drill) , or a Challenge Shrine (Shrines) , modifiers will activate. Gun Fairies (Gun Fairy) that spawn from broken pots when no other enemies are present will as well. Each wave spawned by Drill (Drill) will have a different set of modifiers, even if multiple happens in the same room. Certain effects won't be generated for certain bosses, as there would be no way to beat these rooms; for example, Wallmonger (Wallmonger) and Zone Control. If the player stands within the intersection of multiple supply crates, the time it takes for all crates in the room to disappear quickens. Being put at 1/2 heart by High Stress will not make Blasphemy (Blasphemy) lose its sword beams if you would normally be at full health. If playing as The Robot (The Robot) or if Hazmat Suit (Hazmat Suit) has been acquired, the player is immune to the shockwave effect and can cross the shockwave links safely. However, the bullets linking the electricity will still deal damage. If a Shockwave bullet is erased, the electricity will remain linked to the place the bullet was erased. Despite having no hearts, The Robot (The Robot) does die from getting hit twice in a High Stress room. One piece of armor will be destroyed once hit, and the remaining armor will visually disappear briefly. If a player has Remote Bullets (Remote Bullets) with Unfriendly Fire, bullets that hit walls will still follow the player's crosshair. Sniper Shell (Sniper Shell) s on top of the Wallmonger can be killed by using Big Boy (Big Boy) . The bullets released by enemies when Final Attack is active will always be identical to whatever type of bullet they attack with (e.g., King Bullat with bouncing bullets, Skullet with sharp-tipped bullets). Therefore, enemies such as Blobulin do not release any bullets. Final Attack works differently on Shotgun Kin; instead of making them shoot out a normal ring of bullets, it always makes them burst into 6 bullets like they normally have a chance to (unless they are a variant which does not burst into bullets, in which case they will release a ring of bullets as usual). Explosive Pyres effectively nullifies Final Attack and/or Ghost of the Shell if they both activate in the same room, as the explosion will erase the ring of bullets or kill the Hollowpoint released by the enemy. If Gorgun's Gaze and Shockwave appear in the same room, they will take turns activating. If Cursed Ceramics appear in a room that already has Cursed Pots in it, additional ones won't spawn. Cursed Pots created by Cursed Ceramics will be affected by Pot Shots. Blasphemy (Blasphemy) can destroy an object and erase its resulting Pot Shots bullet with one swing. Supply crates spawned by Zone Control can block Minecart Turrets from moving if they spawn/are pushed onto the tracks. Each phase of the Lich boss fight will have 3 random modifiers instead of a unique one. In a room with the 'Long Live the King' modifier, enemies that are not the king can be killed by getting pushed into a hole. Similarly, in a room with \"Last Bullet Standing\", the invincible enemy marked with X can also be killed prematurely by pushing them into a hole instead. The 'Long Live the King' modifier doesn't prevent the player from devolving enemies that aren't the king. These spawned Arrowkin can be killed even before defeating the King. If a room has Blobulin Rancher and Don't Blink active, the player can purposely miss shots to get infinite money by killing the jammed Blobulin (Blobulin) s. This is not highly recommended if the player does not have contact damage immunity. Chance Kin (Chance Kin) , Keybullet Kin (Keybullet Kin) , Pinhead (Pinhead) , and Nitra (Nitra) will not be affected with Long Live the King or Last Bullet Standing modifiers. If Poison Pursuit is active in the second phase of the fight with the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) , the player may take significant, unavoidable damage or die since the poison trail appears before the player is given control. This should be taken in consideration when attempting this fight in Challenge Mode. If Ghost of the Shell is active in the second phase of the fight with the Resourceful Rat, the Spent he spawns can become Hollowpoints, which can make this fight extremely difficult without a way to clear them immediately. In a room with Thermal Clips, the player can still reload an empty clip without spawning fire by switching into a secondary gun after emptying a clip but before pressing reload, then switching back to the first gun after waiting past its reload time. Alternatively, the player can simply reload obsessively. If Rat's Revenge is active during the second phase of the fight with the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) , the fire traps will be invisible, making them much harder to avoid. If Zone Control activates in the room with the trapdoor leading to the Resourceful Rat's Lair (Resourceful Rat's Lair) , during the controlling, you may notice a square in the floor which doesn't color in yellow, exactly where the trapdoor is located. With Unfriendly Fire modifier, friendly bullets turned hostile won't damage the player if their bullets were imbued by Battery Bullets (Battery Bullets) and the player has electric damage immunity (which Battery Bullets also innately provides). With the Unfriendly Fire modifier, it is very easy to damage a partner in co-op mode, since each player's bullets will inflict friendly fire damage as soon as they leave the gun. Beam weapons such as Unicorn Horn and Moonscraper will never inflict friendly fire damage under the Unfriendly Fire modifier. If a player dies in co-op mode while the Gun Queue modifier is active, any guns they were holding will be lost. Upon revival, they will only have their original starter gun. For this reason, it is recommended that a player with low health either give their guns to the other player or heal to avoid this. Invincible enemies in rooms with modifiers like Long Live the King or Last Bullet Standing can be hindered by status effects like freezing.",

Reloading the Chamber Gun with a full magazine cycles through the unlocked modes. This synergy does not work with Lich's Eye Bullets (Lich's Eye Bullets) . In the Keep of the Lead Lord (Keep of the Lead Lord) , the Chamber Gun is a single target, semi-automatic gun. In the Oubliette (Oubliette) , the Chamber Gun fires poison skulls. In the Gungeon Proper (Gungeon Proper) , the Chamber Gun is a shotgun that is somewhat similar to The Membrane (The Membrane) . In the Abbey of the True Gun (Abbey of the True Gun) , the Chamber Gun is a piercing crossbow. In the Black Powder Mine (Black Powder Mine) , the Chamber Gun is a melee-range, high damage drill. Having Flak Bullets (Flak Bullets) equipped, this form will fire small, spark-like bullets in front of it, with significant damage output. This is a good combination with Orbital Bullets (Orbital Bullets) . In the Resourceful Rat's Lair (Resourceful Rat's Lair) , the Chamber Gun is a rocket launcher which fires cheese wheels that encheese (Status Effects) enemies, similar to those fired by the Elimentaler (Elimentaler) . In the Hollow (Hollow) , the Chamber Gun is a combination of Glacier (Glacier) and The Exotic (The Exotic) ; it fires an ice cube projectile that bounces off walls and enemies, leaves a trail of water, and eventually bursts into several homing rockets. In the R&G Dept. (R&G Dept.) , the Chamber Gun is a pencil which functions similarly to the Wood Beam (Wood Beam) , except that when you reload it, it flips to the other side (Pencil-> Eraser -> Pencil). In the Forge (Forge) , the Chamber Gun is a beam weapon that shoots 2 homing beams of lava in a V-pattern. In Bullet Hell (Bullet Hell) , the Chamber Gun is a homing chain beam similar to the Raiden Coil (Raiden Coil) , hitting all visible enemies at once for high damage. All modes share the same ammo pool. Firing a shot in one mode reduces the ammo of the other modes by a proportional amount. For example, firing one shot in its Hollow mode uses up 10 shots of the base mode, because the base mode has 10 times the max ammo. The Chamber Gun is one of the three weapons in the NONE gun class (Guns#Gun Class) that can be obtained in normal play, the others being the Slinger (Slinger) and the Kruller Glaive (Kruller Glaive) . If the player has Chance Bullets (Chance Bullets) and does not switch to the Chamber Gun from a floor that does not have a Master Round (such as the Oubliette (Oubliette) , Abbey of the True Gun (Abbey of the True Gun) , Resourceful Rat's Lair (Resourceful Rat's Lair) , or the R&G Dept. (R&G Dept.) ), other guns have a chance to shoot bullets from that firing mode.",

Chests can be found locked or unlocked; locked chests need a key to be unlocked, while unlocked chests can be opened for free. Chests found in treasure rooms are always locked, and always contain an item or gun (the chest in one treasure room will always be an item, while the other will always be a gun), unless replaced with a Rat Note (Infuriating Note) . On every floor, one treasure room chest will contain a gun while the other will contain an item. This does not affect drops from destroyed chests, meaning a chest that would normally have an item can drop a gun when destroyed. Upon entering a room with a chest, there is a random chance (affected by Curse (Curse) ) that a fuse will appear by the chest. If the chest is not opened within a short period of time, it will explode, leaving behind nothing. Any item or weapon that can spray a liquid (except for oil) can douse the fuse and stop it from exploding.",

If the player beats the game with Clown Mask, when falling through the vortex during the credits roll, the player will be a skeleton. The reason for this is because the skeleton is the base player model or sprite and the appearance the Clown Mask gives the player is not a regular Gungeoneer, so the game uses the base player model or sprite.

    "text": "Title: Dark Marker\nSection: Notes\n\nNotes\nIf the player has Antibody (Antibody) , Dark Marker's uncharged shots alternate between firing red and blue charged shots without consuming additional ammo. The shots travel straight and become slow-moving orbs after a short period of time, which can deal multiple instances of damage. If any red and blue shots/orbs touch, the blank effect is activated. The charged shot remains unchanged, and will still consume 10 ammo. If the player has Backup Gun (Backup Gun) and the synergy, then shots fired forward will always be blue and shots fired backward will always be red. If a player with the synergy walks backward and forward in place while shooting normally, it's possible to make the slow-moving orbs collide frequently, causing a large number of blank effects. The synergy works well with Double Vision (Double Vision) , as the weapon will always fire one red projectile and one blue projectile at the same time while these projectiles are close to each other, which can cause the blank effect and subsequent explosion to trigger rapidly. If the player also has Ice Cube (Ice Cube) or high Coolness (Coolness) on top of this, the large burst of damage from the rapid explosions from firing Dark Marker while Double Vision is active can recharge Double Vision almost immediately, allowing the player to almost always have the ability to double their damage output while using Dark Marker. In a similar vein, Scattershot (Scattershot) and Helix Bullets (Helix Bullets) make it easier to utilize the blank effect due to putting more bullets on screen. Additionally, Helix Bullets make it particularly easy due to it essentially mirroring the behavior of a charged shot and guaranteeing the projectiles will meet. Additionally, if the player has Remote Bullets (Remote Bullets) alongside the synergy, it becomes much easier to have the uncharged red and blue shots collide as the player can manually move them in to one another by rapidly pressing the fire button twice while keeping the cursor in the same location. If one wishes to be conservative with their ammo, it is best to empty the magazine using normal shots and then use the charged shot. The charged shot will always empty the current magazine, so using it with one shot left in the magazine is the most efficient use of ammo. The blank effect will not reveal secret rooms (Secret Rooms) . The blank effect gains bonuses from Ammolets (Ammolets) . The Gold Ammolet (Gold Ammolet) is a particularly good synergy, allowing the effect to clear entire rooms in a single shot. The blank effect instantly ignites flammable obstacles (such as cobwebs and oil) and destroys obstacles on the ground in a large radius. Unlike most charged weapons, Dark Marker first fires an uncharged shot when the fire button is pressed. This can be avoided by firing while facing against a wall. When the gun is Duct Tape (Duct Taped) to another, it adds two separate ammo bars instead of the expected one. Both look identical but one corresponds to the uncharged shot while the other corresponds to the charged shot. Additionally, its mechanics change substantially: instead of firing its uncharged shot semiautomatically, it automatically fires uncharged shots while the charged shot charges in parallel. This generally ends with both the host gun's clip and the uncharged clip emptying while the charged clip remains near-full. The uncharged shot fired when the player begins charging the weapon does not anger Bello (Bello) . If the player has the synergy, the secondary Dark Marker will continuously fire charged shots that trigger the blank effect. Having items such as Chaos Bullets (Chaos Bullets) is a negative for this weapon, as the red and blue projectiles often have different bullet speeds. If the bullets of a charged shot fail to meet for any reason (due to the effect mentioned above or an NPC (NPC) 's force field, for example), they will become orbs that pierce and deal multiple instances of damage, trailing off until hitting a wall. These are identical to the uncharged shot of the Antichamber synergy. The charged shot of this weapon can damage Cannonbalrog (Cannonbalrog) during his teleporting attack.",

When beginning a dodge roll, the direction the player is moving in determines what direction the player will roll in. The player can only roll in the 8 cardinal and diagonal directions. During the first half of the dodge roll (save for a frame or two), the player is immune to all damage, and can safely pass through bullets unharmed. During the second half of the dodge roll, the player continues to move, but becomes vulnerable to damage. Dodge Rolling over a non-flipped Table (Objects#Tables) allows the player to slide across it along with any connecting tables in the player's direction. Pressing the Dodge Roll key while sliding over a table cancels the table slide, and destroys the table.",

When dodge rolling, while in the air, the player can jump over pits. They are also immune to goop (goop) and will not set off traps (traps) . Dodge rolling into an enemy deals 3 contact damage and slightly knocks them back. The player will take damage if they are still in contact with the enemy during the second half of the roll. If the player deals enough damage to kill an enemy, the player's momentum will not be stopped. Live Ammo (Live Ammo) multiplies dodge roll damage by 5, for a total of 15 damage. Armor of Thorns (Armor of Thorns) multiplies dodge roll damage by 7, for a total of 21 damage. Blast Helmet (Blast Helmet) multiplies dodge roll damage by 3, for a total of 9 damage. If the player has Live Ammo (Live Ammo) , Armor of Thorns (Armor of Thorns) and Blast Helmet (Blast Helmet) , rolls deal a total of 315 damage. After dodge rolling, the fire rate of certain weapons is temporarily slightly increased. Dodge rolls can be made quicker (and therefore safer) by dodge roll upgrades such as the Cloranthy Ring (Cloranthy Ring) . An indirect upgrade is given by the Springheel Boots (Springheel Boots) , which can effectively double the immunity time of a dodge roll. Rolling Spikes are still harmful when dodge rolling. When near a table, flipping the table and pressing the key for rolling at the same time will provide an animation of flipping the table, while the player continues to move. This has the same speed as a dodge roll, while not slowing down the player and having a longer invincibility period.",

Many bosses' attacks are impossible to avoid without using the dodge roll. Only 2 enemies are shown to use the dodge roll, these being the Gun Cultist (Gun Cultist) and the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) briefly when he retreats during his first phase. Technically speaking, the enemy player during the Cultist's (The Cultist) past is also an enemy that can use the dodge roll. The unused form (Unused and Cut Content) of the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) boss spawnable via game modification (Modding) prior to the Advanced Gungeons & Draguns (Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update) update also used repeated dodge rolling as part of its movement pattern. In game, NPC (NPCs) s will refer to the dodge roll (such as Bello (Bello) ), but instead of being known as a move that passes the player over bullets, it is known as a move that passes you through bullets unharmed. This might be a play on how the game appears two-dimensional. This is evid ent by one of Blockner's (Blockner) ghost lines being \"What I don't understand is why the bullets weren't hitting you.

Any attempts to play as Eevee post the Farewell to Arms update will result in the player becoming the Paradox. Attempting to take the elevator to Boss Rush (Boss Rush) with Eevee would softlock the game. Eevee had no nicknames, and as such would be referred to as STRING_NOT_FOUND by NPCs (NPCs) . Eevee’s facecard, bosscard, and map icon were the Hunter (The Hunter) ’s. Eevee and Lamey (Lamey) are the only Gungeoneers that are referred to by name instead of a title. Eevee required 5 to restart a run in order to keep playing the character. When Eevee faced to the right, a pink square the size of the current character's sprite bounds appeared around them. This may have been an error, or (more likely) used to debug the random appearance switches. Eevee may be a reference to the Pokémon Eevee, which can evolve into many different forms, hence them changing when certain conditions are met.

They had tremendously large bores of up to 25mm and were fired at close range, ensuring they would knock out the huge animals they were intended to stop. While the gun present in the game fires a spread, elephant guns loaded single lead projectiles, but they could be rifled or smoothbore. Piano keys used to be made from elephant tusk ivory, hence \"pianos out of teeth\". \"An inelegant weapon for a less civilized age\" is a reference to Star Wars, where the reverse of the phrase is used to describe a lightsaber. The gun could also be a reference to Looney Tunes and Elmer Fudd, the hunter who chases Bugs Bunny and uses a similar two-barreled shotgun. The lines \"shoots elephants\" and \"used to make pianos out of teeth\" might thus be referencing gags which occur in several episodes. The fact that the gun fires two shots could be a reference to George Orwell's 1936 essay \"Shooting an Elephant\", in which the narrator recounts shooting an elephant multiple times. The Elephant In The Room synergy's special bullets' appearance may be a reference to , a recurring enemy in the Kirby series.",

The synergy is a reference to Lewis Carroll's poem ''Jabberwocky'' (wikipedia:Jabberwocky) . The synergy is likely a reference to the , a weapon from the Final Fantasy RPG Series. The gun's name and sword-like appearance are a reference to the Excalibur, the sword associated with King Arthur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake. The name of the weapon is a portmanteau of Excalibur, the sword, and caliber, the internal diameter of the barrel of a gun or of a projectile. The weapon's quote is a reference to T. H. White's work The Once and Future King (wikipedia:The Once and Future King) , which is largely about King Arthur's life. The gun's appearance when held by the character is likely a reference to the Qualta Blade carried by Ka D'Argo in . Specifically, the stylized grip that splits off from the stock/handle, and the way the sword splits down the middle to reveal the rifle. The physical Ammonomicon has a doodle of a crowd of Gundead, along with a crowned Bullet Kin. It's unknown if it's the Bullet King (Bullet King) as a child, another Lead Lord, a possible Bullet Prince, or the mythical hero in the Entry for Excaliber.

Many enemies are only found in specific chambers (chambers) , so shortcuts will cut down the time needed to reach them, allowing you to more effectively farm a floor for the required enemies. * If you go for quest completion only, don't bother defeating bosses; instead, use all firepower available to quickly clear rooms in order to cut down the time needed for each quest. (Progress is saved regardless of quitting, restarting, dying, or completing a chamber.) ** The three shortcut starter items only reset once that chamber's boss has been defeated. If you find a particularly useful or powerful set of starter items, it may be beneficial to simply restart your run before and instead of defeating the boss, allowing you to repeatedly farm a chamber using the same set of starter items on offer from the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat#NPC) . * If you use shortcuts to find specific enemies, use Rainbow Runs (Rainbow Run) to obtain powerful weapons immediately upon starting a floor. ** Unlike the three shortcut starter guns, items found in the starting Rainbow Chest ''' reset with each new run even without killing the boss between attempts. * If unlocked, speak to Tonic in The Breach to activate Turbo Mode (Turbo Mode) for quicker runs. ** Combine this with toggling on \"Increase Speed Out Of Combat\" in the options menu for even more speed. * Some Gungeoneers are more effective than others when the goal is specifically to complete hunts via shortcuts: ** The Marine's (The Marine) innate faster reload speed, starting armor, and active ability to refill ammo makes him all-around very effective. ** The Convict's (The Convict) starter Sawed-Off and double damage when injured allows for quick room clears and rewards a fast, aggressive playstyle, which is well-suited to hunting runs. * Turning the High Dragun (High Dragun) into the Advanced Dragun will not count as a kill towards the last quest. * For boss specific hunts, using Boss Rush (Boss Rush) can help guarantee an encounter",

If you're close, focus on backing off and only start circling once you've gained some distance. Once you are at a comfortable distance, circle and dodge roll when a bullet strays especially far, and its low health will often mean a quick victory. * Try to avoid staying still. Its bullet spread is very dodge-able, but it will constantly walk toward you, and getting trapped against a wall will usually result in a hit. * When it is firing its large bullet that explodes into smaller bullets, take note of where it's going and either get behind cover or try to gain extra distance to safely dodge bullets from two directions at once. * When it is firing the two wide spreads of bullets, try dodge rolling sideways instead of towards the bullets. The timing is a bit harder, but dodge rolling towards Gatling Gull twice will often leave you too close to avoid his follow-up attack. * The eighteen small pillars arena is very large, allowing you to very easily get away from Gatling Gull, as his large size prevents him from following you quickly around corners. * Another perk of the large arenas is that you may walk backwards for much longer while shooting at the Gatling Gull, and when combined with the occasional sidestep, this is an effective strategy for dealing large amounts of damage at a time. * When it starts firing rockets, it will stand still for an extended period of time.

The Glass Cannon is one of the few guns able to bypass the Boss DPS cap (Bosses#Notes) . Holey Grail (Holey Grail) , if used properly, can refill ammo for Glass Cannon. If Glass Cannon is picked up before Holey Grail, its ammo can be refilled to half-full upon taking damage. However, if Holey Grail is picked up first, Glass Cannon will break and ammo will not be refilled. This can be avoided by simply dropping Holey Grail and picking it up again. When in co-op mode, the synergy activates regardless of who has which item. If the wielder of the cannon doesn't have the stone, they can receive damage while holding the cannon and it will not shatter.",

The gun is a reference to the Glass Cannon archetype in video games, referring to characters with high damage but low defense. The synergy is a play on the title of the video game series Max Payne. Both Glass Cannon and Void Core Cannon (Void Core Cannon) have \"Cannon\" in their name, yet do not trigger the synergy. With the Max Pane synergy, the game enters slow motion when hit, as a reference to Max Payne's bullet time feature. Since the shattered sprite is invisible, if the player dies while the Glass Cannon is popped, it will appear to not be shown in their list of owned items on the end screen. Throwing a shattered Glass Cannon doesn't show a weapon indicator on the map, indicating that throwing a shattered Glass Cannon really makes it disappear.",

The Gun Nut's name may allude to the Darknut from series, a similarly heavily armored and oddly named enemy. The name Darknut was an error by the Japanese translation team; the original word intended was \"Knight\", not \"Nut\". The error became popular and has stuck ever since. Similarly, the Chain Gunner references the Ball and Chain Soldier from games such as and . The quote references the game's protagonist. This is also why they appear as the sole enemies in the throne room of the Bullet's past, which is another reference. Furthermore, the name of the Chain Gunner is likely a reference to the Heavy Weapons Dude from Doom 2, which was nicknamed the Chaingunner by the fans. The Chain Gunner's chain can be destroyed by Blasphemy, but returns when it completes a full rotation. A Chain Gunner will still throw its ball and chain if a Keybullet Kin is the only enemy left.",

    "text": "Title: Gungamesh\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nThe name is likely in reference to the ancient king and major figure in Mesopotamian mythology, but his appearance as a red-robed humanoid with blue skin is a reference to the Final Fantasy series, where Gilgamesh is a multi-armed weapon master from another dimension. According to his Diginomicon entry, Gungamesh came from the same dimension as the Mine flayer (Mine Flayer) and seems to be in conflict with the Killithid (Killithid) race. However, since the Killithid's Ammonomicon entry states that \"The Killithid exists in a dimension of psychic gunplay, where the need for a gun is superfluous.\", it is implied that both Gungamesh's four grey revolvers and his powers of bullet summoning and teleports come from his psychic abilities. The line in Gungamesh's description about his kind using \"hundred percent of their arms, as opposed to the more common seventy-five percent.\" is in reference to the popular myth (wikipedia:Ten percent of the brain myth) that human beings only use ten percent of their brains.",

Phase 1 will be a fight against its bird form while phase 2 will be a fight against its egg form. ''' In its first phase, the Gunruda appears as a giant, wrathful bird whose rage engulfs it in red, hot flames that are just as fiery as the blasts from its flamethrower. Driven into madness by its curse, the Gunruda acts berserk with its happy-go-lucky shooting manner and its energetic eyes. For phase 1, the following are the key attack patterns of the Gunruda: * Constantly emits a circle of fire from its body every 3 seconds * Follows the player and fires its flamethrower in a cone shape * Leaves a trail of flames as it moves * Fireballs rain down on the map, which leaves a patch of flames on the ground for 1.5 seconds * Special Effect: ** Every time it is in Phase 1, once its hp bar hits 30%, the battle will enter phase 2 ''' Key events during the transition to phase 2: * Gunruda will drop its flamethrower and gradually turn to an egg * An area of the floor will also turn to lava, leaving a limited area for the player to play around in. ''' In the second phase, The Gunruda transforms into a mini golden glowing egg that protects it from defeat as it recoups its fiery energy. For phase 2, the following are the key attack patterns of the Gunruda: * A flame shield, capable of blocking any incoming damage, forms around the egg for 5 seconds, every 30 seconds. * The egg emits a stronger circle of fire from its body every 2.5 seconds. * Lava bursts from the floor every 5 seconds, splashing on to a random area in the floor. * If the egg is not defeated within 3 minutes, the Gunruda will emerge once again at 60% hp. This means that it will go back to phase 1 and the special effect will still activate once it reaches the threshold.

The player can carry an unlimited number of guns. All guns come in 5 \"types\": , which automatically fire bullets when holding down the shoot button and generally have large magazine sizes. , which can also fire by holding down the shoot button but generally fire faster by tapping it, and have small magazine sizes. , which need the fire button to be held for a short moment before the release of the projectile (some guns don't need to be charged to shoot, but the uncharged shots deal less damage). , which are similar to Automatic, except they fire a continuous beam rather than individual bullets. , which work like Automatic or Semiautomatic, but fire multiple shots per trigger pulled. All starting guns, along with Gunther (Gunther) , Elimentaler (Elimentaler) , Casey (Casey) , Dueling Laser (Dueling Laser) , Windgunner (Windgunner) , Betrayer's Shield (Betrayer's Shield) with the synergy, and the AKEY-47 (AKEY-47) with the synergy have an unlimited amount of ammo, but are unable to reveal secret walls. All other guns have a limited amount of ammo, enabling them to reveal secret walls. Additionally, ammo can be replenished by finding ammo pickups. (Pickups#Ammo) If a gun is out of ammo, it can be thrown by holding down the fire button and deals 20 damage if it hits an enemy. This damage can be increased by the Ruby Bracelet (Ruby Bracelet) , which will make the thrown guns explode upon contact with an enemy. Thrown guns can detect secret rooms. Four guns do not appear in the Ammonomicon (and this list): the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) , used in Winchester's (Winchester (NPC)) game; the Mimic Gun (Mimic Gun) , which can rarely replace any gun and must be used until the player picks up ammo or does enough damage; the High Dragunfire (High Dragunfire) , found only in a special Secret Room (Secret Rooms) ; and the Windgunner (Windgunner) , which can be temporarily used when Sprun (Sprun) transforms. All guns (except those with magazines the size of their entire ammo capacity), after emptying a clip, will have to reload, which takes a short time, varying with the gun. This time can be reduced by various means (Reload Speed Boosts) or entirely negated, such as by the synergy. If a gun is left unequipped for double the time of its normal reload, it will passively reload. If the player is too close to a wall and is facing it directly, the gun will not be able to shoot. This prevents loss of ammo by accident in cases which bullets wouldn't hit any enemies by any chance. If left on the ground, guns will be stolen by the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) . If the player has the Ring of the Resourceful Rat (Ring of the Resourceful Rat) , guns can be traded for a similar-powered (Quality) item, while having the synergy removes the stealing entirely. There are currently 243 guns in the game total, including 191 base game guns, 15 guns that were added in the update, 15 guns that were added in the update, and 22 guns that were added in the update.",

The classes that particular guns fall into are listed in the rightmost column of the table above, and a full list of the different class types is as follows; NONE, PISTOL, SHOTGUN, FULLAUTO, RIFLE, BEAM, POISON, FIRE, ICE, CHARM, EXPLOSIVE, SILLY, SHITTY, and CHARGE. Each gun has ONE class chosen from the list. \"SILLY\" guns are guns that don't work \"seriously\" in gungeon. A \"SILLY\" gun could be a joke, be something that not actually a gun (like being a melee weapon), be a strong reference from another franchise, or being \"magic\". \"SHITTY\" guns are guns with mediocre general stats or with obvious disadvantage, which makes them poor choice in most situations comparing to other guns. Most of starting guns are SHITTY guns. Having a gun of a certain type in the player's inventory reduces the chances of another gun of the same type generating as loot by 50%. E.g.; Having a shotgun makes the player 50% less likely to find another shotgun. The exact formula is as follows, where 'A' is the amount of guns of the same type in the player's inventory. There are two exceptions to this: NONE class guns do not affect the rarity of other NONE class guns. SHITTY class guns have a slightly tweaked formula. Instead of each gun making the others 50% less common, each SHITTY gun makes obtaining another SHITTY gun 90% less common.",

Gunther may also be a loose reference to the Ready Player One book series as “Gunter” is a phrase used to describe those in the original contest for Halliday’s Easter Egg. When shooting a north wall, Gunther's bullets will leave hitmarkers that resemble the letters N, R, and Φ, which also happen to be the same attacks that Bookllet (Bookllet) s use. Also, when shooting a secret room entrance on a northern wall, the symbols left on the wall will be far lower on the wall than normal. When Gunther's magazine is fully empty, the face on the gun will appear to be sleeping. Gunther has two reload animations. When reloading a partially empty magazine, the character flips him end over end. When reloading a fully empty magazine, the character tilts Gunther on his side and shakes him. Gunther may be a reference to the Gallows Dodger, a special weapon in Saints Row: Gat out of Hell (wikipedia:Saints Row: Gat out of Hell) that also has infinite ammo, gets stronger by killing enemies, and talks to its user. The Jealous Weapon reference may come from Gunther from the TV show Friends. Gunther's appearance resembles that of from the game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (wikipedia:The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind) . It also resembles the generic minimap icon for NPCs (NPCs) , such as the defeated police officer from the Badge (Badge) .

The Primerdyne corporation in the Ammonomicon entry is reminiscent of Cyberdyne, the corporation who developed the technology leading to the fall of mankind at the hands of artificial intelligence in the franchise. The minions it summons resemble imps from the series and are referred to as such in the game files.

This enemy's name is a pun on kill and Illithid (Wikipedia: Illithid) , a race of creatures from ''Dungeons and Dragons'' (Wikipedia: Dungeons and Dragons) . The Killithid also seems to be referencing the most common form of Cthulhu, as per its design. Its ammonomicon entry references the tagline of Metal Gear Solid, \"Tactical Espionage Action\". The symbols that appear above Killithid when it attacks (the blue X, the pink square, the red circle, and the green triangle) are a reference to the PlayStation DualShock controller. If the original Killithid is under a status effect such as poison when it creates illusions, only the original will have the status effect, allowing it to be easily spotted. If the original Killithid is being jammed by a Jammomancer (Jammomancer) and creates illusions, those illusions will be jammed, even if the Jammomancer is killed. While firing, Killithid illusions can be pushed around but the original cannot. This can be used to find the original quickly and without wasting bullets. The Killithid's portals will continue to fire after the Killithid has been frozen.",

Fires a single fast, homing bullet. Spawns four Tombstoner (Tombstoner) s. After the first phase is defeated, a hand will burst out of the ground after a small delay and drag the player down into the arena of the second phase. In this phase, the Lich stays stationary above the player. He has several different attacks: Pounds the arena with one hand, sending out randomly scattered bullets and a wave of normal bullets off to one side. Many bullets then travel horizontally across the arena starting from that side. The smaller, flashing bullets will disappear halfway across the arena. Opens his rib cage, sending rings of bullets towards the player. A few of the bullets in the rings will then travel towards the player. Opens his rib cage, sending many waving lines of bullets towards the player. Pounds the arena with both hands, sending rows of bullets across the arena from both sides.

After the second phase is defeated, the player will be sent to a new arena where the third phase will materialize. In this phase, the Lich floats towards the player, and has more different attacks: Fires a rocket made out of bullets that flies out to the side, then flies towards the player, leaving many bullets in its wake. Fires lines of bullets towards the edges of the arena, then makes them rotate at varying speeds. Fires lines of bullets throughout the arena, with several links breaking off towards the player. Creates bullets in a gun shape, then fires the bullets towards the player. Fires a boomerang of bullets towards the player that curves back towards the Lich. Travels up and down the center of the arena, rapidly firing lines of bullets to the sides. Fills the arena with bullets except for a small cone, then rotates the cone while a wedge of bullets sweeps across the safe area. Sprays bullets above and below himself while spraying waves of bullets to the sides.

    "text": "Title: Lich\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nThe Lich's silhouette can be seen on the title screen. The second phase of the Lich's bossfight is internally referred to as the 'Megalich'. The final phase is internally referred to as the 'Infinilich'. During the first phase of the Lich's bossfight, he holds his revolver with his right hand, however, in his bosscard he holds the gun in his left. The fireplace in the Keep of the Lead Lord (Keep of the Lead Lord) is crowned with a large painting depicting an elderly Gunslinger (The Gunslinger) wearing the Lich's clothing and holding a living bullet. The bullet depicted in the fireplace painting may be the same bullet depicted in the Lich's bosscard. The scenery of The Lich's boss fight is a reference to the final duel in a circular cemetery on Sad Hill in the movie \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\". The Lich's second form bears significant similarity to the appearance of the demon Shell'tan depicted in the Ammo Shrine (Shrines) . The bone of the Lich's forehead is punctured by a bullet wound, a motif shared with Revolvenants (Revolvenant) and the exterior of The Gungeon (The Gungeon) itself. The Lich's third form has the limbs of a Revolvenant (Revolvenant) , the composition of a Shelleton (Shelleton) , and the features of his previous phase. The subtitle Gungeon Master 'GnD', 'Gungeons and Draguns'''. The Lich may also be a reference to the Tomb of Horrors (wikipedia:Tomb of Horrors) , a Dungeons and Dragons module (pre-made adventure) in which the players descend a complex labyrinth of enemies and traps, culminating in a climactic battle against the tomb's master, . According to Riddle of Lead (Riddle of Lead) ’s Ammonomicon description, Riddle of Lead belonged to the first person to master the Gungeon and thereby gaining the envy of Kaliber. It is likely that this person was The Gunslinger or Lich (depending on if this mastery occurred pre or post mortem). This is reinforced by the synergy between Riddle of Lead and Lichy Trigger Finger (Lichy Trigger Finger) . The Lichy Trigger Finger is stated to be finger of an ancient gunslinging lich. This is implied to be the Lich in Bullet Hell, but not directly stated. Of note, the Lich does not appear to be missing any fingers in either his bosscard or second phase sprites. The Lich's first phase sprites are more difficult to judge due to them being considerably smaller, but the Glitched Lich death animation from the Gunslinger's Past seems to show four fingers on each hand. While both his bosscard and second phase each have five fingers, this does not necessarily mean that the Lich is intended to be depicted with missing fingers in his first phase. Drawing characters with fewer than normal fingers is a common artistic choice (especially in a medium as restrictive as small-scale pixelart) where attempting to render a full number of fingers would look messy. Even though no missing fingers are visible in the Lich's bosscard, the bosscard also only shows the Lich's left hand. The Lich has no fingers in his third phase, as his arms and hands are replaced by bullets. The Gunslinger used a pair of bullets as prosthetic eyes, a trait which persists into the Lich's design. These bullets can be obtained in the form of the item Lich's Eye Bullets (Lich's Eye Bullets) , which grants all weapon synergies and is the starting item of the Gunslinger character. The description of Lich's Eye Bullets suggests that the use of prosthetic bullet eyes may not be out of any sort of necessity, but rather for show. The prosthetic eye bullets can be seen resting in a pile of ash on the victory screen after defeating the Lich. The event which killed the Gunslinger, leading to the creation of the Lich, was The Great Bullet (The Great Bullet) striking the Gungeon. After the Lich is defeated, the text on the ending screen permanently changes from \"You Killed The Past\" to \"Evil Banished\". The ornate chest containing The Gun That Can Kill The Past is referred to internally as the 'Cache of the Ammulich'. It is possible that 'Ammulich' was an in-development name for the Lich, but the term is used nowhere else in the game's sprites or code.",

While it only has six shots instead of eight, the description, shape (such as the band around the rifle's forend), and the distinctive pinging reload noise suggest this rifle is the M1 Garand (wikipedia:M1_Garand) , the famous semi-automatic rifle that served as the mainstay of the US Army in World War 2. It could also be the later M1 Carbine (wikipedia:M1_carbine) based on the detachable box magazine (though this might lead one to expect a magazine capacity of 10, 15, or 30 and no distinctive \"ping\"). However, the weapon in-game is listed as bolt action while both real-life counterparts are semi-automatic. The synergy is a reference to the MIDA Multi-Tool from the Destiny series. The boost to movement speed is based on MIDA's unique perk, and its appearance resembles a scout rifle from the Destiny series. It resembles an M14 battle rifle, which was a replacement for the M1 Garand battle rifle using box magazines rather than an internal en-bloc-clip-fed magazine, and was capable of select-fire. The synergy is a reference to the final scene of the movie Jaws, where Martin Brody shoots a gas tank in a shark's mouth with an M1 Garand, making it explode.

Because Gunboots' projectiles are considered as first shot fired bullets, they get Macho Brace's effect, robbing a player of \"proper\" charged shot from their weapon. As such, this can be considered a somewhat negative synergy, since the player can only apply this bonus to charged weapon shots while Gunboots' projectiles are on cooldown. * Roll Bomb (Roll Bomb) is affected by Macho Brace, just like Gunboots, though its synergy with this item is more negative, since Roll Bomb activates for every dodge roll, and thus effectively takes away the possibility to use Macho Brace as intended from the player. * Cat Bullet King Throne (Cat Bullet King Throne) is affected by Macho Brace. This affects all of the bullets coming out of the throne, not just one. However, if the throne was off cooldown, and fired bullets, the glow duration is greatly reduced, to almost 0.

This allows them to shoot multiple consecutive shots at a higher damage. * When playing as The Paradox (The Paradox) , the glow around the player appears pink and white. * Bullets that are shot by projectiles such as Bullet (Bullet) are not affected by Macho Brace. * When paired with the bullet modifier from Helix Bullets (Helix Bullets) , occasionally only one of the Helix Bullet's projectiles will be fired, resulting in a loss in damage.

Likewise, the gun's Ammonomicon entry is likely a reference to EA shutting down Mythic Entertainment shortly after the release of \"Dungeon Keeper\", as Dodge Roll was started by a team of ex-Mythic employees. The randomness of its projectiles may be a reference to lootboxes, a common in-game purchasable that provides random items to buyers. The Microtransaction Gun is available as an added DLC on Steam, thus allowing players to make a microtransaction to obtain the Microtransaction Gun immediately rather than unlocking it normally through gameplay.

Unlike regular enemies, Mimics will often hold off attacking until approached or interacted with by the player, after which they'll suddenly strike. Most Mimics will give off subtle clues that they are not what they seem, allowing observant players to catch them out. Examples of this are Chest Mimics opening and closing slightly, and Pedestal Mimics “blinking”. Mimics have a chance to replace Chests (Chests) and Boss (Bosses) loot pedestals, and will attack the player if they attempt to collect the treasure they're carrying. Upon death, the chest variants can drop items (items) , guns (guns) and sometimes additional pickups (pickups) , with the guns and items the Mimic drop always being the corresponding Quality (Quality) that would be expected from the chest color the Mimic was disguised as. Pedestal Mimics always drop the item or gun they were originally displaying, as well as another gun or item of the same quality. Mimics can also come in the form of items; the Mimic Gun (Mimic Gun) has a small chance to replace any gun.",

    "text": "Title: Mimic\nSection: Notes\n\nNotes\nMimics can only be encountered after at least three hours of total playtime. Chests have a base chance of 2.25% to turn into a Mimic. This chance increases by 2.1% for each point of curse (curse) the player has. Chest Mimics can be distinguished from actual chests as they will occasionally open their mouths slightly. Also, shooting them will provoke the Mimic into battle. Pedestal Mimics are more subtle, and can be distinguished from actual pedestals as the markings on the rim resemble a face with tiny eyes that regularly blink. They are also slightly darker in color. Shooting them will provoke the Mimic into battle. Rat Chest Mimics can be seen moving but their movements are incredibly subtle. It is advised to shoot each one as the chests won't break before opening them. Wall Mimics are visually undetectable except for occasionally appearing as fake doorways on the map. Accidently getting too close or shooting one will provoke the Mimic into battle. Much like Secret Rooms (Secret Rooms) , that crack if bullets from Gundead (Cult of the Gundead) hit them as well as the player, they can also provoke Wall Mimics. Wall Mimics can also spawn in the starting room of new floors, being one of the few enemies to be able to attack you in the supposed \"Safe\" spawn room, aside from the Lord Of The Jammed, and any mimics that may chase you throughout the entire floor. Attacking a Mimic before it attacks the player will unlock the Book of Chest Anatomy (Book of Chest Anatomy) . The first shot on a Mimic, revealing it, will never deal damage. Mimics that appear as a chest with a fuse will not be triggered if the player lets the fuse run out, but instead explode and no item will be dropped. If these Mimics are provoked, the fuse is extinguished. Dog (Dog) will repeatedly bark if it senses a mimic. This includes the otherwise almost undetectable Rat Chest Mimics. During a Rainbow Run (Rainbow Run) , Bowler will sit on any chest, regardless of whether or not it is a Mimic. However, if there is more than one chest in a room, he will only sit on one of them, again regardless of whether or not it is a Mimic. Killing a Mimic during a Rainbow Run will still not drop items, and won't even drop pickups. Instead, Bowler will leave a note exclaiming his disgust for Mimics. Mimics cannot be transmogrified by magic weapons. In Frifle and the Grey Mauser (Frifle and the Grey Mauser) 's Mimic quest, Door Lord (Door Lord) and Pedestal Mimics count as a Mimics. Brown chests that appear to be unlocked will always be Mimics if encountered in a chest room. This also includes the cellar-like Secret Room (Secret Rooms) that always contains 3 chests. If a Mimic appears as a locked chest, it can be provoked by attempting to open it with a key; the key will be consumed. If the Mimic is provoked by being shot instead, its treasure can be gained without using a key. This can make Mimic encounters a blessing in disguise. Picking a Mimic's lock with Trusty Lockpicks (Trusty Lockpicks) does not provoke it, regardless of the outcome. A dysfunctional lock does not prevent a Mimic from being provoked. If the player has the synergy , the floating Demon Head (Demon Head) will look at an unrevealed Wall Mimic instead of the direction the player is looking when a room has been cleared. Pedestal Mimics can only replace pedestals topped with guns or items. The Old Crest (Old Crest) pedestal, the numerous ones seen in the Resourceful Rat's treasure room, and Master Round (Master Round) pedestals cannot be mimics. Mimic Tooth Necklace (Mimic Tooth Necklace) makes almost all chests and pedestals mimics. This excludes any pedestal that appears after defeating Wallmonger (Wallmonger) , chests won from Winchester (Winchester (NPC)) 's game, all Rainbow and Synergy chests, Glitch chests, and Rat Chests (Chests#Rat Chests) . Aside from Rat Chests, the aforementioned can never become mimics. Mimics do not deal damage on contact. Before they are interacted with, Mimics are immune to most \"unaimed\" attack forms. Room-wide damaging effects such as BSG (BSG) shots do not harm them, homing weapons such as the Yari Launcher (Yari Launcher) do not home in on them, and armed companions such as Super Space Turtle (Super Space Turtle) ignore them. The Boomerang (Boomerang) , however, does strike unopened Mimics. Prior to A Farewell to Arms (A Farewell to Arms) , Wall and Pedestal Mimics did not drop items. Pedestal Mimics are the only mimic to never wield guns. If a Mimic manages to enter Bello's shop, he will not be alarmed. If a Mimic is killed by falling into a pit, the items it drops will not be lost and will appear on the edge of the pit.",

If they kill the player, guns and active items will be unusable upon quick restart, despite entering the game. Wall Mimics can make holes in walls that can sometimes activate the next room. If it leads to a chest room, the player can teleport in and ignore the previous room. If a Wall Mimic is pushed into a pit by a rolling spike trap (Traps) , the game will crash.

If the Helmet somehow gets stuck on one of the obstacles (for example, being trapped between a spinner and the wall), after a few seconds of the helmet not moving, the kick will be declared a mulligan, and the player will be allowed to have another shot free of charge. The Ledge Goblin sits on a platform at the top of the stage. If the player manages to aim the helmet directly at her head, she will duck to avoid it. If the player scores a direct hit on her body, she will be knocked over backwards by the force of the helmet. This has no effect on the game. One of the possible obstacles is a floating Lead Cube (Lead Cube) drifting back and forth across the stage. This is the only place where Lead Cubes appear in Exit the Gungeon.",

The description is also a joke about the Flat Earth Theory, stating that the planets are flat and only appear as if they were spherical. It's also a joke about the game itself, since in Enter the Gungeon (like all computer games with 3D graphics) is two-dimensional but exploits perspective to appear three-dimensional. \" Music of the Spheres (wikipedia:Musica universalis) \" refers to a long-standing ancient mathematical concept which relates the rotation of the heavenly bodies to various mathematical proportions, as well as the pitch of a string to its size. The phrase, and concept, was popularized in philosophy by Pythagoras, and later Plato. \" Accretion (wikipedia:Accretion (astrophysics)) \" refers to the process that forms planets out of stellar dust.

    "text": "Title: Old King\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nBefore the Supply Drop Update (Supply Drop Update) , the Old King had the same splash screen quote as the Bullet King (Bullet King) . This boss is a reference to Old King Doran from Demon's Souls; not only is he an \"Old King\", he defends a crypt as an optional boss. Doran also drops the 's Ring — the description reads as follows: \" .\" His name and attack patterns may be a reference to the Bullet King (Bullet King) in the beta, as there are images where he is shown to throw a flask that spreads in an X formation much like the Old King. The Old King has a Bullet Kin next to him that, like the chancellor in the Bullet King boss fight, will chase you around if shot. The Chancellor's base health is 1000 (and since the Chancellor is in Abbey of the True Gun (Abbey of the True Gun) , its health is multiplied by the floor's health scaling, which is 1.6666…), and the damage done to the boss when you blast him with Casey (Casey) is 1000 × 1.6666… × 2 = 3333.33…. Interestingly, this is higher than the Old King's health by only a sliver. The design and fight patterns of the Old King, in addition to his location and the theme of the Abbey, seem to suggest he is the previous Lead Lord. The design of the Abbey, his throne room, and the vast difference in difficulty also suggest he was a much fiercer ruler. The physical Ammonomicon depicts the old king being shoved off his throne by Cannon (Cannon) , implying that Cannon was the one to kill him. The gargoyle-like statue heads decorated behind the Old King resemble that of the two demon statues seen just before the boss fight against Doctor Wolf's Monster (Dr. Wolf's Monster) . The physical Ammonomicon shows a doodle of the Old King being pushed off his throne by Cannon (Cannon) and Agunim (Agunim) , meaning that the Old King had met Agunim at one point before being defeated and retreated into the Abbey of the True Gun (Abbey of the True Gun) . The Old King is the third most durable boss in the game, having slightly more health than the High Dragun (High Dragun) (not including his Advanced Dragun phase), but has less health than the Lich (Lich) and the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) .",

One (or two) water barrels (Barrel) can almost always be found randomly in a separate room on the same floor. This water barrel can rarely spawn inside of the Oubliette entrance room, necessitating use of a goop to extinguish the fireplace. The fireplace is also able to be extinguished by Blobulin (Blobulin) , Blobuloid (Blobuloid) , and Blobulon (Blobulon) if it places goop close to the fireplace. Weapons such as the Barrel (Barrel) , or items like the Coolant Leak (Coolant Leak) can spawn water or spread goop on use, allowing them to extinguish the fire and allow access to the secret floor. After extinguishing the fireplace and activating it, the chance for a water barrel to spawn within the same room as the Fireplace increases dramatically for the save file. The spawn chance for this water barrel appears to be independent from water barrel spawns outside of the fireplace room. In some rare cases the second barrel might be in the hidden room, rendering it impossible to enter it when the first water barrel is destroyed. After reaching the Oubliette once, the water barrel usually spawns in the fireplace room or a room adjacent to it. The hidden room contains a hatch with two locks. Unlocking both locks (which takes 2 keys) opens the trapdoor, and entering the trapdoor leads to the Oubliette. These locks work identically to wall locks and can be opened with Trusty Lockpicks (Trusty Lockpicks) or a Drill (Drill) .

This item may be a reference to the German movie \"Siegfried\", where a pig saves the protagonist's life by jumping in front of an arrow. The name may be a reference to a viral video titled \"Pig rescues baby goat\", in which a pig appears out of nowhere to assist a drowning baby goat. (However, there was no sacrifice and the video was staged.) This item may be a reference to the anime \"Seven Deadly Sins\", where the talking pig Hawk, the Captain of the Order of Scraps Disposal, has identical properties. The synergy is a reference to the final fight against Mother Brain in , in which after the baby Metroid is killed, Samus gains the Hyper Beam. The synergy refers to the stuffed pig carried by Marvin Boggs (played by John Malkovich) in . Malkovich also played the assassin in , which the Composite Gun is based on. The synergy is a reference to the in-game boss Cannon, himself a reference to Ganon from the video game series. The synergy name refers to Cannon returning in some form via the appearance of the pig. The synergy being named \"The Return\" may also be a reference to the game-over screen from , which includes the line \"RETURN OF GANON\". The pig's green color may also be an reference. The \"Shifty\" description may be a reference to the from the first mass effect game, where if you turn your back on one of the alien cows it will steal your money, which pairs with the description as a seemingly normal pig that might not be the best to pig to have around.",

If the player also has Bracket Key (Bracket Key) or Bionic Leg (Bionic Leg) , Polaris gains 20% increased damage, increased ammo capacity of 700, increased magazine size of 30, increased fire rate when leveled up, automatic firing, and a new appearance. The distance between the two bullets that fire at level 2 is wider with this synergy. The gun does not change appearance between levels with this synergy. Taking any damage, even while the gun is not equipped, will decrease its level. Taking damage while at level 1 resets any progress made towards the next level. Dropping Polaris will reset its level. Level 2 requires killing 11 enemies of any type, while level 3 requires an additional 20. Polaris's level does not affect its selling price. While level 1 and 3 fire a single projectile of varying damage, level 2 fires two. Because of this, level 2 projectiles have the probability of gaining chance-based bullet effects (e.g., Vorpal Bullets (Vorpal Bullets) , Katana Bullets (Katana Bullets) , Hungry Bullets (Hungry Bullets) , etc.). When used alongside Helix Bullets (Helix Bullets) at level 2, the two bullets fired follow the same helical pattern instead of cris-crossing one another. Prior to the Supply Drop Update (Supply Drop Update) , Polaris had 400 maximum ammo. The symbol for reaching level 3 appears every time after killing an enemy once Polaris is at level 3 and it has killed a large amount of enemies. If Polaris is combined with another weapon with Duct Tape (Duct Tape) it fires all 3 levels every shot, consuming 3 ammo. It does not change level if the player takes damage. Prior to the Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update (Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update) , Polaris had 0.07 fire rate. Trading hearts with the Vampire (Vampire) will not affect the level of Polaris.",

Powerups that copy passive items are often stronger than the item they copy. For example, Homing Bullets grants much stronger homing (so much so that some weapons will curve their bullets to hit enemies opposite the direction of fire) and Hot Lead will make ALL bullets burn enemies. 'Blessing of Kaliber' is the only powerup that is not based on a passive or active item from Enter or Exit the Gungeon. Certain powerups based on active items from Enter the Gungeon do not match the effects of their predecessors precisely. The Potion of Lead Skin Powerup does not reflect enemy bullets back at their owners upon their contact with the player. The Aged Bell Powerup doesn't stop time, merely slowing it.

It will only happen the first time that particular instance of the item is picked up, so it can be dropped and picked up without further increasing magnificence. The increase is permanent and cannot be removed by dropping, selling, or destroying the item. This magnificence counter will carry over to the next floor. Set to the number of red and black chests upon generation of each floor. Opening or destroying one of these chests (and only these chests, not any other red or black chests that may have spawned on the floor) decreases chest magnificence by 1. Magnificence from unopened chests does not carry over across floors. Whenever the game wants to generate a floor reward item (be it a floor generation chest, a room clear reward chest, a boss reward item, or a shop item) and the result turns out to be an or tier reward, the quality has a chance to be downgraded. \"Item magnificence\" and \"chest magnificence\" are added to create magnificence, and if the resulting number is 0, the reward will not be affected. If the number is above 0, the chance that the reward quality is downgraded rises logarithmically. The exact formula for the downgrade chance is: The first few values for the formula are: If the reward is downgraded, the quality of the item or chest is rerolled with the same chance distribution as before, but without the chances of it being or quality, resulting in a chest or item of , , or quality.",

Most of the time it doesn't matter, since opening a rare chest and picking up the item increases magnificence anyway, but it may be relevant for and tier active items which may not be beneficial to take. Basic heart container items, such as Heart Holster (Heart Holster) and Heart Purse (Heart Purse) do not increase magnificence, even if found in a red chest. Heart of Ice (Heart of Ice) does not increase magnificence even if found in a red chest. Lament Configurum (Lament Configurum) increases magnificence even though it is a tier item. The Seven-Leaf Clover (Seven-Leaf Clover) overrides magnificence's effect on chests found in chest rooms.

The 'Pirate Shotgun Kin' does not have hands, unlike most other gundead in the game who handle weapons. Their weapon appears to float.

The 'Red Bullet Fish' is described as red, but it is clearly blue. This may be a reference to the rhyme 'One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish'. The Cactus uses the sound effects of the Fungun (Fungun) when it attacks. The 'Angry Necronomicon' may be related in some way to the unused ' Dread Book (Dread Book) ' enemy. The 'm80 Guy' is based on real m80 fireworks, which are often used by the military for combat simulations.

These tilesets had been in the files before A Farewell to Arms (A Farewell to Arms) and were part of a set of unused extra floors, but were not used until the update. Sense of Direction (Sense of Direction) will not work on this floor, possibly due to the fact this floor is not randomly generated and has the same layout every time and possibly because this floor is not left through an elevator. The R&G Department is the only floor that does not contain common enemies such as Bullet Kin (Bullet Kin) , Red Shotgun Kin (Red Shotgun Kin) , Blue Shotgun Kin (Blue Shotgun Kin) , and Pinhead (Pinhead) s. It contains, instead, reskins of these enemies. The music featured on the floor was part of the original soundtrack, with \" \" and \" \" being the soundtrack to the first half of the level and \" \" and \" \" being the soundtrack to the latter half. The name is pronounced as RNG, being a pun on \"Random Number Generator\" referencing the game being a rogue-like and R&D, \"Research and Development\". It is unconfirmed, however, what the acronym actually stands for, but may possibly stand for \"Run & Gun\", or even \"Research & Gunvelopment\". The former is somewhat ironic, as the R&G Dept. is the only floor that is randomly generated.

The synergy with Fortune's Favor is a reference to the character Fortune from Metal Gear Solid 2 (wikipedia:Metal_Gear_Solid_2:_Sons_of_Liberty) , who wields the weapon. Ironically, Fortune doesn't wield the final production model seen in ; she wields the prototype (Prototype Railgun) . The synergy is a reference to Fortune's squad, the Dead Cell Unit. The flavor text is a reference to the character of the Mass Effect (wikipedia:Mass_Effect) franchise. A running joke (both in universe and in real life among fans of the series) is that Garrus really likes to calibrate guns. The Railgun does not need to be charged until the guiding lines fully converge. In fact, the weapon will fire around halfway through its full charging animation, because it is \"charged\" as soon as the small cloud of smoke emerges around the player.",

The player will be able to grab one of the items, and only one. This is the only source of items throughout the run, and most other items are removed: At least one and one item is guaranteed to spawn. The remaining items have an approximate distribution of 12% , 41% , 23% , 12% , and 12% . Items in shops, on pedestals and from The Lost Adventurer (The Lost Adventurer) and the Gunsling King (Gunsling King and Manservantes) are all removed. Bowler will sit on all non-rainbow chests, preventing the player from collecting items. Note that this means if the player finds a brown chest or similar that Bowler is not sitting on, then it is a natural rainbow chest and can be safely opened. Any non-rainbow chest opened will appear empty, and Bowler will leave a note saying that he took the item. Using a key on a non-rainbow chest will consume a key with no payoff, which can prevent access through the Oubliette (Oubliette) and Locked Doors, such as a lock having a chance to appear at the Old Crest (Old Crest) 's room. Other than those instances, Keys are not needed much in Rainbow runs. This includes chests from Winchester (Winchester (NPC)) 's game, the mirror room, the Truth Chest, rat chests and paid Synergrace (Synergrace) 's synergy chests. Keys are still consumed if the player tries to open a locked chest. Pickups (Pickups) , Lies (Lies) , Junk (Junk) , Gold Junk (Gold Junk) , and Ser Junkan (Ser Junkan) (if Ser Junkan spawns as junk instead of an item) dropped from destroyed chests remain collectible, but other items retrieved from breaking a chest will be replaced. If a chest is destroyed, there is a chance that a note will appear from Bowler that he took an item, and no Junk or pickups can be obtained. This replaces things like tier Guns that can drop in normal runs. If the chest or pedestal (Pedestal Mimic) is a Mimic (Mimic) and the player kills it, Bowler will leave a note instead of an item. In co-op, Bowler will sit on revival chests, but they will still revive the dead player if opened. Shrines (Shrines) like the Companion Shrine or gift reward from the Dice Shrine will not work, but negative effects like a heart container removal from the Companion Shrine will still happen if interacted with. Spawned chests (chests) will be immediately replaced by a note. Mirror Rooms (Objects#Mirrors) are completely useless as the chest cannot be destroyed to obtain Junk.",

Bowler also cannot take the Bullet That Can Kill The Past (Bullet That Can Kill The Past) . Bowler cannot take the Gnawed Key (Gnawed Key) . Junk (Junk) will never be taken. This includes Lies (Lies) , Gold Junk (Gold Junk) , and Ser Junkan (Ser Junkan) (if Ser Junkan spawns as junk instead of an item). Rainbow runs are especially useful to The Robot (The Robot) because of this, as his power increases if he collects junk. Items are still dropped by the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) during his punch-out phase. Munchers (Munchers) and the Witches (Witches) function as normal. Rainbow chests found naturally still contain items, all eight of which can be picked up. Using a Shortcut (Shortcuts) will still provide a selection of three guns, in addition to the starting level's Rainbow Chest. You can take as many guns as you can normally have, For ex. on floor 2 you can pick one File:D Quality Item.png (File:D Quality Item.png) tier gun and on floor 5 you can get all 3 File:B Quality Item.png (File:B Quality Item.png) tier guns. Spice (Spice) will still have a chance to replace pickups after being consumed as normal. Knight's Gun (Knight's Gun) will still dig up items as normal. Spraying the Demon Face (Demon Face) with a water gun will still drop an item. Items that spawn upon clearing a room like Glass Guon Stone (Glass Guon Stone) s and rarely Supply Drop (Supply Drop) s are still obtainable. However, chests that spawn on room clear be taken.

The Rainbow Chests always spawn 4 guns and 4 passive/active items. Getting a Glitch Chest (Glitch Chest) will still result in going to the next level, making the player fight two glitched Beholsters (Beholster) . However, since Bowler will take all eight rewards usually given by this fight, this is not recommended. It is possible for the starting rainbow chest of a floor to be a Glitch Chest. In this case, the chest will still present as a Rainbow Chest and yet when opened will not allow the player to take an item, transporting the player to the next stage with two glitched Beholsters. If Spice (Spice) is used, Spice can appear as room rewards and miniboss rewards. It will also be purchasable in shops. Occasionally, Bowler will appear standing on a chest praising the sun and when you approach the chest, it bursts into flames. It's possible to destroy it before it burns away, giving Junk, but it has a higher chance to explode. You can encounter the Rift that allows you to unlock the Paradox in Rainbow Run. Rewards will not be given by Gunsling King and Manservantes (Gunsling King and Manservantes) . Using a Companion Shrine (Shrines) during this mode will remove a heart without giving you a companion. The Sorceress (Sorceress) 's blessing can be activated during a rainbow run, bypassing the need to collect guns from the rainbow chest. Bowler will leave a note after every boss battle asking if the player got hit during the battle, whether or not they did. If a player dies in co op mode, single coloured chests may still be used to revive a player, but if the player dies before opening the rainbow chest, it will turn into a revive chest until they are respawned. After that, the rainbow chest will work as normal. Rainbow Mode allows for a high likelihood of encountering the Clone (Clone) , even after dying and respawning due to the Clone. This allows for easier acquisition of duplicate Master Round (Master Round) s, making unlocking Super Hot Watch (Super Hot Watch) easier as well. Multiple Clones are still decently rare. If a new game file is started where the player intentionally avoids unlocking S-tier items besides Clone before rescuing Bowler, the available pool of S-tier items for the chest to give will be significantly reduced and result in Clone appearing much more often than usual. The following items cannot drop from a Rainbow Mode chest: Gungeon Blueprint (Gungeon Blueprint) Seven Leaf Clover (Seven-Leaf Clover) Shelleton Key (Shelleton Key) Chest Teleporter (Chest Teleporter) Old Knight's Flask (Old Knight's Flask) Mimic Tooth Necklace (Mimic Tooth Necklace) Gun Soul (Gun Soul) Briefcase of Cash (Briefcase of Cash) Ballistic Boots (Ballistic Boots) Ring of the Resourceful Rat (Ring of the Resourceful Rat) Ring of Chest Friendship (Ring of Chest Friendship) Lament Configurum (Lament Configurum) Book of Chest Anatomy (Book of Chest Anatomy) Medkit (Medkit) Chaff Grenade (Chaff Grenade) Cluster Mine (Cluster Mine) Smoke Bomb (Smoke Bomb) Iron Coin (Iron Coin) Escape Rope (Escape Rope) Ser Junkan (Ser Junkan) These items can rarely be collected . They can be found in natural Rainbow Chests, or the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) 's 3rd phase. If Ser Junkan has not previously been unlocked, he can drop from destroyed chests in a Rainbow Run. Items can still be exchanged with the Ring of the Resourceful Rat (Ring of the Resourceful Rat) . Items can also be exchanged with the Witches (Witches) . If the player opens the rainbow chest and leaves the room without taking any items, the Resourceful Rat will steal the items left behind. The rat will steal one of the items and leave a note as usual, but this will also count as picking up one of the items, causing the other seven to disappear and a note from Bowler to appear. Interestingly, the rat always seems to take the top right item first. Defeating the High Dragun (High Dragun) in a Rainbow Run will cause a generic gold trophy to appear in the Breach to the right of Bowler. Opening Rat Chests (Chests#Rat Chests) for the first time in a Rainbow Run will not unlock Rat Boots (Rat Boots) , Resourceful Sack (Resourceful Sack) , Partially-Eaten Cheese (Partially-Eaten Cheese) or Elimentaler (Elimentaler) . Bowler will still take the items and leave a note.",

There is also a visual bug where Bowler will not sit on top of Rat Chests (Chests#Rat Chests) , but will be positioned on the floor as if he were sitting on a smaller chest. There is a glitch in co-op mode where the two players can grab two different items at the same time. If the glitch is successful, the players should have the items they took, along with 2 other items in the chest on the floor that they can pick up. The players have to pick up the items at the exact same time for this to work. Dropping Rainbow Loot obtained this way has a chance to cause it to disappear. Occasionally, if timed right, if one player grabs the item on the right, and the other player grabs the top-right item, the majority of the remaining items will actually remain. (Usually all items remain.) If a player collects an active item with an active item currently held, the previous active item may disappear. Despite the fact that most chests spawned as room rewards are replaced by a Note while a Rainbow Run is active, Synergy Chests are not affected by this and will appear as normal, though they will still not give an item. If Rainbow Mode is activated, talking to Bowler yields two options. Selecting “Just wanted to chat.” causes the old avatar of your character to appear if you are playing as one of the four main characters. If playing as The Bullet (The Bullet) , the avatar is instead a black square. This doesn't affect The Robot (The Robot) , The Paradox (The Paradox) or The Gunslinger (The Gunslinger) .",

Their video \"Wonder Boy\" includes lutes too. * This gun's ability to buff companions may be a reference to the Bard's ability to give allies inspiration in Dungeons & Dragons. * In the final scene of The Bullet (The Bullet) 's past, a Coaler (Coaler) is holding it, despite the scene being added in the Supply Drop Update (Supply Drop Update) . * The tag line \"Purple Prose\", is an expression that refers to overly flowery and elaborate prose. * Before the Farewell to Arms Update (A Farewell to Arms Update) , this gun was an unused reskin of the Face Melter (Face Melter) and acted identically to the Face Melter, firing notes in four directions. * This gun may also be a reference to the Golden Lute from the Crypt of The Necrodancer series.

If the player has Mimic Tooth Necklace (Mimic Tooth Necklace) , a mimic with googly eyes will tell the player the Mimic Union is spread thin and can't provide mimics for the Rat Chests. Despite this, the Rat Chests can still be mimics. The chests can be opened using Trusty Lockpicks (Trusty Lockpicks) and Drill (Drill) .

    "text": "Title: Resourceful Rat\nSection: NPC\n\nNPC\nIn his most frequent encounter, the Resourceful Rat is an NPC (NPCs) who will steal anything left on the floor except: Health, blanks, keys, Hegemony credits, and Glass Guon Stones, which will never be stolen. Armor and other items floating off the ground, like in secret rooms, will also be left alone. After stealing an item, he will leave a note on the ground thanking the player for the loot before calling them a random insult. The Resourceful Rat can be interrupted before he puts an item into his bag, doing this will allow the player to enter any room connected to the room with the item in it without the Resourceful Rat returning. This mechanic can be especially useful with ammo, as it allows players that do not immediately need ammo to clear out the surrounding rooms before picking up the ammo, letting them refill a gun with less rounds in it. If the player shoots at the Resourceful Rat while he is stealing an item, he will call the player a \"Jerk!\" and disappear. If the player takes a shortcut (Shortcuts) to the second chamber onwards, the Resourceful Rat will be in the elevator room wearing a mask resembling Bello (Shop) and offer the player a varying selection of three free guns. These guns will not change unless the player completes a floor after taking an elevator. In the Gungeon Proper, the guns are , and one of the three guns can be taken.

The Resourceful Rat will drop various pickups, items, and guns whenever successfully hit, which can be picked up after the fight ( Magnificence (Quality#Magnificence) is ignored). It will always drop 5 guns/items in this order: 1 or tier, 1 tier on the last hit of phase 3A ( tier instead if your last hit is a super punch), 1 / tier , 1 tier, and 1 or tier on the final hit (phase 3C). In this phase, the Resourceful Rat has three health bars of increasing difficulty that must be depleted in order to defeat him. Bold attacks can be interrupted when the rat flashes yellow in order to charge the player's super attack. If the Rat at any point lands an attack on the player, the player's super attack charge is reset. In this phase, if the player runs out of health or the timer runs out, the player will lose. The player will not die; the Rat will simply run away and leave a note. Any pickups the Resourceful Rat has dropped can be collected, including Rat keys. It is advised not to continuously punch the rat while he is blocking, as this will tire the player over time, leaving them temporarily unable to dodge. It is strongly advised to alternate left and right punches whenever possible, as this maximizes how many times the player can hit the Rat before he starts blocking again. Without alternating, the player can only get 3 hits in; with alternating, this increases to 6 (or 10 if performed after he gets dizzy from his 4-hit tailspin attack in the third phase.) If the rat is knocked down with a super punch, he'll swing with Casey (Casey) before the next round begins, this attack must be blocked or dodged.

Use of the Super Hot Watch (Super Hot Watch) can allow massive amounts of momentum to be build up on the corpse, at which point it ricochets around the room repeatedly. During phase 3A, when the rat starts the transition to phase 3B, using a super punch will skip phase 3B entirely. Successfully defeating the rat in all 3 phases will make the rat unable to steal from the player for the rest of the run, even without the Resourceful Indeed synergy. It is highly recommended to fight the Resourceful Rat during Rainbow Mode (Rainbow Mode) , as Bowler will not take any weapons or items won from the Punch-Out phase. However, he will prevent the player from getting items from the rat chests.

During phase 2 and 3, there is a glitch that can trigger if the player dies to the rat's counter punch for trying to punch him too soon while he prepared to eat cheese.  This causes the player's life to restore to full and the game to go into slow motion rendering the rest of the fight significantly easier.

    "text": "Title: Resourceful Rat\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nThe mech piloted by the Resourceful Rat in the second phase of his boss fight is modeled after Metal Gear REX from . In that game, the protagonist Solid Snake battles his twin Liquid Snake while the latter is piloting Metal Gear REX and the two have a fist fight on top of it afterwards, much like the duel in the final phase. The mech is actually called Metal Gear RAT in the game files. The duel is referred to as Liquid Punch-Out in the game files. The ending sentence where the Resourceful Rat requests that you remove your mask to see your face with his own eyes is likely a reference to the death of Darth Vader from Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (wikipedia:Return of the Jedi) . The Rat can be shot at after defeating the third phase, and can be knocked into the pit this way without hearing his speech. The rat will beg for mercy and demand you let him tell you his life story. When in co-op, a player will not be revived if dead after the rat's third phase. If the ghost of this player flies over the pit, both players will teleport to the loot room. All of the rat chests look like revive chests, but dispense the same items as a rat chest and do not revive the ghost player. These chests do not require Rat Keys, therefore making them free to unlock. The chests will disappear once opened, will spawn confetti and play the revive noise as if they revived the ghost. Any other chests found after the rat floor will appear normal but will revive the dead player. The rat Spent (Spent) that appear in the Rat's lair and boss fight are similar in appearance to Mousers from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. Upon defeating The Resourceful Rat's first phase, his Ammonomicon entry seems to be in his own wording. Upon defeating The Resourceful Rat's second phase, his Ammonomicon entry is updated to how it rightfully should be. The first entry reads as follows: \"This dashing thief is respected and feared throughout the galaxy, as the most accomplished and wealthy adventurer in the universe, and also the true High King of the Gungeon. His moniker refers both to his cunning and his near limitless resources, which he earned through countless successful attempts at conquering the Gungeon, though he has no regrets to slay. So mighty is he that pilgrims travel from across the stars to leave offerings in his glory, increasing the magnificence of his great hoard. Many have tried to best him in combat, and all have failed.\" Another entry states the following: \"This rat-creature never sought the Gungeon for its treasures, but instead found himself cast here upon the tides of fate. Born in the hold of a trading vessel, he was forced to steal for his family's survival, until a great tragedy befell his mischief. When the next ship docked, he escaped and found himself alone on this planet. Here he wandered, until finally coming upon the Gungeon. Stuck in its time loop, he made a nest and a name for himself while training daily. His martial prowess is undeniable, and in truth he likely possesses the skill to reach the Gun. During his trials, however, he found his calling: being an ass to Gungeoneers. The gun interests him not; in his eyes, he has no regrets, for he is King.\" This is similar to the speech he gives before he dies, when his third phase is defeated. Dying to The Resourceful Rat will cause the book to have scribbles on it, and yields one of several unique death messages, under the section labeled \"Killed By\": Your very slow reflexes Your sad lack of skill Your head not being in the game Your lack of commitment Your misplaced ambition Your hubris Your pride The Handsomest King High Lord Gungeon Someone better than you The Richest Rat The \"your very slow reflexes\" death message references the \"your own slow reflexes\" death message, which is used as a failsafe if the player is killed by something after it dies (such as a Lead Maiden's bullets) or dies to certain entities (such as the Chancellor). The disguise that he wears when greeting the player upon skipping to a floor resembles Bello (Shop#Bello) the Shopkeeper. After defeating the Resourceful Rat, a pair of golden boxing gloves connected by a chain show up in the Breach, hanging from one of the beds. There is a 1 in 4096 or about a 0.02% chance of finding the way to the rat without any notes. The comment the rat makes about it being statistically insignificant that you would find him starting at missing 3 notes could reference the scientific standard for something being statistically significant of 95%. While at missing only 2 notes you only have a 93.75% chance of missing the rat, meaning it is still considered reasonably possible to reach him, the chance of missing him missing 3 notes is 98.4375%. If the player is on Nintendo Switch, the pattern to get to the Rat appears to remain constant. With the pattern being: Down, Right, Down, Up, Down, Up. The Phrase \"Say Cheese And Die!\" on the Ammonomicon entry is most likely a reference to the GooseBumps horror novel of the same name.",

    "text": "Title: Ring of Triggers\nSection: Notes\n\nNotes\nThis item's usage can be maximized by using it with an active item that automatically recharges or has a low cooldown, granting a burst of damage every 10 seconds. Examples include: Melted Rock (Melted Rock) Shield of the Maiden (Shield of the Maiden) Jetpack (Jetpack) Sense of Direction (Sense of Direction) iBomb Companion App (iBomb Companion App) Grappling Hook (Grappling Hook) Busted Television (Busted Television) Duct Tape (Duct Tape) ; using Duct Tape once disables it, but dropping it and picking it up again reenables it. The player can also maximize the benefit of this item by using a gun or bullet modifier that allows the shots fired to bounce or be retargeted, such as Serious Cannon (Serious Cannon) or Remote Bullets (Remote Bullets) . The shopkeeper (Shop#Bello) does not count the ring's effect as firing in his shop, making it helpful for finding breakable walls in the shop. This item fires all the bullets a weapon can fire at once. For example, it fires all three of Polaris (Polaris) 's levels at once and fires Blasphemy (Blasphemy) 's sword beams even when not at full health. However, this does not apply to duplicates of the same bullet type (i.e. as fired by Shotgun-type weapons). As such, it is not recommended to use Ring of Triggers while holding shotguns. If two guns are Duct Tape (Duct Tape) d together, Ring of Triggers will only fire bullets from the second gun. Old Goldie's (Old Goldie) damage boost will apply to bullets fired by Ring of Triggers as long as the gun is being held, nearly doubling damage output. If the player dodge-rolls with the Macho Brace (Macho Brace) equipped, Ring of Triggers can fire several shots with its damage bonus. Using Camera (Camera) with Ring of Triggers resembles the effect of Bracket Key (Bracket Key) . Strangely, using Kruller Glaive (Kruller Glaive) causes all glaives to be fired directly at the mouse, rather in the spiraling spread pattern typically associated with the item. Ring of Triggers' effect can shoot Makeshift Cannon (Makeshift Cannon) 's bullets in all directions, dealing high damage without consuming its ammo. Active items could be recharged immediately due to the high damage. As shown in the image below, Ring of Triggers can be used to fire extra shots in Winchester (Winchester (NPC)) 's game, but the inaccuracy of its ability leaves its usefulness in question. If duplicates of this item are somehow obtained, it causes twice as many bullets to be fired for every use of the active item. However, the second set of bullets is stacked directly on top of the first, making it hard to see them in practice.",

Martin's 'And Seven Times Never Kill Man!' from his 'Thousand Worlds' series. The gun could be a reference to anti-riot weapons such as the Long Range Acoustic Device (wikipedia:Long Range Acoustic Device) (LRAD), which uses a form of non-kinetic and non-lethal form of crowd dispersal. This also appears to be referenced in the Ammonomicon Entry. This gun could also be a reference to the Pulse Gun from Crimsonland (wikipedia:Crimsonland) , which made such an annoying sound that players often had to mute their game, \"losing their purpose and conviction\" in reference to the gun's description. The stun effect is also similar to the Pulse Gun, which confused enemies, except without the added knock-back effect. This gun could also be a reference to the Address Disruptor from Axiom Verge (wikipedia:Axiom_Verge) . The shape of the bullets match that of the disruptor, and both not only make rather weird noises, they also hinder enemies in some way. This gun could be a reference to the Ripple Laser from the Gradius (wikipedia:Gradius) series. In its first appearance, it took the form of multiple orange \"hoops\" that grew in a stilted manner as they travelled, much like the Screecher. Additionally, the Ripple Laser made a somewhat annoying sound when fired, reminiscent of the Screecher.",

Welcome to the Halls of Knowledge! Here, don the Hat of the Pupil. Let's begin! Lights! Due to the carelessness of regretful souls wantonly firing a weapon that rips through time and space... the Gungeon is crumbling. To reach the exit in time, you must ascend via the Tinker's (Tinker) network of makeshift elevators (Routes) . I've instructed my assistant to set-dress the Halls of Knowledge to approximate what your environment will be as you The first and most important thing to master is the Dodge Roll. Observe my assistant. To Dodge Roll, press the (dodge button), while moving Left or Right. Try it now. Can't figure it out? That's ok, I'll remind you. Perfect Dodge Rolling! Now, do it a few more times! Good. Great. Nice. That's enough. Ready to move on? <Yeah, let's continue> <Actually, let me try one more time> Because your Dodge Rolling skills are excellent... There is one other thing I would like you to try. Legends tell of an ancient Gungeoneer who ascended when he Dodge Rolled. It is referred to as the... Ascending Dodge Roll. The scriptures say that to perform this fabled technique you must...  Press (Dodge Up Button). No, that's a normal Dodge Roll. Yes! Dear Kaliber, the height! You've mounted that precipice! You can also Dodge Roll while you are in the air by pressing (Dodge Button) or (Dodge Up Button) again before you land. You should try it when you get the chance. But how will you get down? Hmm... Try... Dodge Rolling! No, that didn't work... hmm... Try... another Ascending Dodge Roll! Perhaps if you go high enough you'll eventually... wrap around and reach me again. Now you're even higher! What you need is some kind of... Descending Dodge Roll. I have an idea! Hold (Down button) and press (Dodge Up Button). Oh, you're still going... You should come down now. Hey, since you went all the way up there. Can you grab that FLYING DISC (Flying Disc) ? Welcome back! Surely I must be the to have discovered this powerful technique... Excellent! Now that you are well versed in all three types of Dodge Rolls, we can put them to use. When you Dodge Roll, you are invulnerable until you hit the ground. This means you can Dodge Roll Bullets. And, in the Gungeon, Bullets will be flying everywhere. On my command, the walls will begin to fire Bullets. To survive, you must time your Dodge Roll so that the Bullets pass you while you are in the air. As long as you are in the air, you are invulnerable. The easiest way to time it is to roll towards the Bullets, away from them. It can be counterintuitive, I know. I assure you however that this is a battle tested technique. Ready... Go! Oh, you've been hit! Don't worry, the Bullets in the Halls of Knowledge are non-lethal. In the Gungeon however, you can only take a few hits before you're dead. Try again! Oh boy, you've been hit X times now. X hits... that's not great. X Hits. That's X hits... in the Gungeon, you would now be dead. That was a little late. To early! Remember, Dodge Roll the Bullets would hit you. Excellent! Do it again! One more time!",

He will become enraged again if the player repeatedly fires in the shop after the fact. *** This counts for the items too, as their prices will be reset to normal. ** Several items and guns, including Gunboots (Gunboots) and Cat Bullet King Throne (Cat Bullet King Throne) , do not anger Bello. * The Payday 2 items ( Clown Mask (Clown Mask) , Drill (Drill) , and Loot Bag (Loot Bag) ) have special shop spawning conditions if they have not been unlocked. ** Before they are unlocked, they have a 5% chance to replace an item in the shop, or a 100% chance if the Biggest Wallet achievement has been unlocked.

The Slinger has zero bullet spread and its accuracy cannot be decreased, making it one of the most precise guns in the game. The Slinger is the fastest-firing of all the starter weapons. Uniquely, Slinger has two reload animations. If reloaded with an empty clip, the Gunslinger will throw it and get a new one from his belt. If the clip is not empty, then the gun will spin. The gun thrown when the clip is emptied will retain its original appearance even if the gun's appearance when held has been modified by an item, such as Platinum Bullets (Platinum Bullets) . The Slinger is one of the three weapons in the NONE gun class (Guns#Gun Class) that can be obtained in normal play, the others being the Chamber Gun (Chamber Gun) and the Kruller Glaive (Kruller Glaive) . The Slinger being in the NONE class may be an intentional attempt to avoid skewing the Gunslinger's loot pools. Most character starters other than Blasphemy (Blasphemy) are in the SHITTY gun class, which makes many other low tier guns less common. Since many low tier guns have synergies (synergies) making them much more powerful, the Slinger being in the NONE class may be to prompt them to show up more often as the Gunslinger.",

His Hidden Compartment (Hidden Compartment) becomes more of a mixed bag; he can collect an additional active item for handling emergencies, but his ammo bonus makes forcing a gun to switch (by wasting its ammo) more tedious. ** The Hunter (The Hunter) loses her Crossbow (Crossbow) , swiftly putting her on the same level as the Pilot in the early game. This makes her Dog (Dog) her only distinguishing feature. The power of her Dog is slightly diluted by Ammo being practically useless, but acquiring more Pickups on room clears means she can save more for items (and more for Flynt (Flynt) 's items). ** The Robot (The Robot) swiftly loses its high-capacity Right Hand (Robot's Right Hand) , but its Battery Bullets (Battery Bullets) and Coolant Leak (Coolant Leak) combo remains, giving it an alternative source of damage for emergencies. It retains its 5% damage boost from each new piece of Junk (Junk) it touches this run, which is far more significant in blessed runs than in normal runs; if one values the 5% damage boost the same as all active-and-passive items averaged together, the chance of getting something useful from '' a chest is ''' better than the chance from '' a chest, and holding onto a Key makes the chance from chest-breaking ''' better instead. ** The Bullet (The Bullet) swiftly loses Blasphemy (Blasphemy) , making Live Ammo (Live Ammo) their only distinguishing feature. This puts them in a similar position to the Convict, in that they're both distinguished by having a means of emergency damage if their gun is terrible. The Bullet's emergency damage is tougher to use, but it isn't tied to taking or dealing damage. Live Ammo also gives them immunity to contact damage. ** The Paradox (The Paradox) doesn't get its random primary gun, and its random sidearm is swiftly overwritten. Its random passive item is thus its only defining feature. Having only one chance to possess something good, instead of its typical two chances (three if you count the random sidearm), makes the Paradox even more hit-or-miss than before. ** The Gunslinger's (The Gunslinger) Eye Bullets (Lich's Eye Bullets) greatly diminish the primary downside of blessed runs, by making most guns significantly better. The primary issue is that several guns have their functions significantly changed beyond mere stat increases, which can throw off players unused to such synergies. * Using Quick Restart to restart a run removes the blessing if the player cannot afford another blessing. * If the player enters the Halls of Knowledge (Halls of Knowledge) with a blessing, they will not have a gun at all. * Any gun that is obtained through the held gun changing will not be added to the Ammonomicon. However, a gun that is picked up during a blessed run will be added, even though it immediately changes to something else. * Gun/item generation (such as on pedestals and in Shops (Shop) ) is unaffected by the blessing, though the guns will immediately change when picked up. Chest (Chests) contents are unchanged as well. ** Notably, this means that the second Treasure Room chest in a chamber will still have a gun if the first had an item, and vice-versa. ** This also means that, if you don't pick up a new gun in a chamber before defeating its boss, the boss pedestal reward will always be a gun. * Entering a boss (Bosses) room will change your gun right after the fight begins, though it will fire before changing if you were holding a charged gun's charge (such as from the Glass Cannon (Glass Cannon) ). * As of v2.1.9 (v2.1.9) , it appears your held gun can only change into guns that can spawn in Chests (Chests) . This disqualifies the Gungeoneers (Gungeoneers) ' sidearms, with the exception of Blasphemy (Blasphemy) after it has been added to the loot pool. * During a blessed run, the Dueling Laser (Dueling Laser) does not recharge like an active item. Instead it automatically reloads in around 7 seconds. * Shortcuts (Shortcuts) are blocked off during a blessed run. * Muncher (Muncher) s and Evil Muncher (Evil Muncher) s cannot be fed guns during a blessed run. * Guns can be given to the Peace shrine, refreshing your gun and healing you 1 full heart. This can be very powerful, as it allows easy gun refreshing and infinite health for the floor. * Guns can be given to the Beholster shrine as in a normal run, the player will immediately be given a new gun. ** Although it takes a lot of time, guns can be fired until they run out of ammo to change the gun until one of the six guns is acquired, but getting Casey (Casey) or Gunther (Gunther) will ruin this trick. * Having your gun change via the blessing does not cancel the effect of the Metronome (Metronome) . * Beam weapons tend to switch to another random gun extremely quickly compared to other guns, sometimes within the span of a few seconds of firing. ** If a gun deals less than 3 damage in a single hit, it counts as 3 damage towards the 200 necessary to switch; therefore, each tick of a beam weapon counts as 3 damage, requiring only 67 ticks to switch guns. * Weapons received from NPCs, such as The Lost Adventurer (The Lost Adventurer) , will not be randomized. This includes the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) . * The AKEY-47 (AKEY-47) will still unlock chests and locks. * The effect of the blessing will not carry over into a Gungeoneer's past. * Damage dealt by the genie summoned with the Magic Lamp (Magic Lamp) does not count towards the next gun. * If the player does not have enough Hegemony Credits to afford the blessing, the Sorceress will wave the player away, and her guards will assume a fighting stance.",

Due to this, the player might wish to wait until they have acquired sufficient weapons and items before using Spice. In co-op, both players can pick up Spice multiple times. Each player will go through Spice's uses separately. If a player dies but is resurrected by the partner, all of Spice's effects will be lost, but the number of uses will be remembered. No other form of resurrection does this. Like other limited-use active items, Spice will stack with itself and multiple Spice can be carried at once. Each time Spice is used, the pickup quote changes: On first pickup: After first use: After second use: After third use: The player cannot die by using Spice to drop below 1 heart container. However, using Spice after the player's health is at 1 heart container will prevent items that normally provide heart containers from adding heart containers until the sum of the player's starting heart containers and added heart containers minus the number of heart containers lost from Spice is greater than 1. If Spice is used by The Robot (The Robot) , it will not add or remove armor, which makes Spice a very powerful item to be used when playing as The Robot. Spice can replace the Prime Primer (Prime Primer) and the Gnawed Key (Gnawed Key) . The player can buy it for 90 coins. If the player has 40 Spice in their inventory, the game will stop spawning more Spice. If the player has the Knight's Gun (Knight's Gun) , Spice can still be dug up even after 40 have been obtained.

With an ammo capacity multiplier of 0, guns will not be able to shoot at all, and will always be out of ammo. There is no way to achieve this in the vanilla game, however. Similarly, with ammo capacity multiplier set to a negative number, guns will to have a negative number in their ammo counter, but firing will not shoot a bullet, and will just reset currently held ammo to 0. There is also no way to achieve this in the vanilla game.",

This works because the Tarnisher is larger than the player and cannot turn as sharply. * Guns with a magazine size of 1 are unaffected by Tanisher's magazine size reduction. * The Tarnisher's magazine size reduction stacks additively - getting swallowed 2 times reduces it by 30%. ** If the player is swallowed 7 times, resulting in a 105% reduction, every affected gun gains infinite magazine size. *** When this happens, guns with special shots at the end of the magazine, like Mailbox (Mailbox) , every shot becomes the special shot * If the player has Shield of the Maiden (Shield of the Maiden) when swallowed, the Tarnisher will not damage the player but instead swallow the item. The item is then dropped by the Tarnisher when killed. * The Tarnisher can be killed by explosions, such as those produced by a Nitra (Nitra) , when it is chasing the player. * The Tarnisher can be killed by environmental damage or companions while the player is swallowed to prevent them from doing damage and lowering magazine size. * The Tarnisher will damage the player even if they are immune to contact damage. * If a Tarnisher dies while spitting the player out, the game will crash. * If two Tarnishers catch the player at the same time the game will crash. * If the player has the Wolf (Wolf) , and the wolf kills the Tarnisher before it spits the swallowed player back out, the player will be freed and they will not take damage. * If the player has the Full Metal Jacket (Full Metal Jacket) and has blanks, being swallowed by a Tarnisher will not harm the player or consume a blank. Magazine sizes of all of the player's guns will be affected. * If the Tarnisher is jammed, it will not do a full heart of damage but rather just the regular half a heart. * if the Tarnisher is killed by the blood shrine's effect during the spitting animation the player will not take damage",

In co-op, the last shot of each magazine heals the other player for half a heart if shot at them. This shot costs 1 ammo when fired, and an additional 24 when the heal occurs. The AoE effect only lasts as long as the weapon's reload time. This means that any item that increases reload speed (such as Galactic Medal of Valor (Galactic Medal of Valor) ) nerfs the AoE effect by ending it early. This also applies to Cog of Battle (Cog of Battle) , in which case the effect is also canceled early by the active reload, making it often favorable to not use the active reload to prolong the AoE effect.",

    "text": "Title: The Bullet\nSection: Strategy\n\nStrategy\nThe Bullet is unique in the sense that they turn the Gungeon's rules upside down; their starter \"gun\", Blasphemy (Blasphemy) , completely locks them in melee combat and cleaves bullets with every slice, while their passive item Live Ammo (Live Ammo) grants the user complete immunity to contact damage while making dodge rolls an alternative attack. The Bullet is fully capable of going through the Gungeon with just their starting weapon, playing the game as a \"hack-and slash\" and getting close to enemies to slash them with impunity due to its upsides; many challenging bosses can become rather trivial because of this. Coupled with Live Ammo, the Bullet is one of the characters who have the easiest times earning a Master Round (Master Round) regardless of the run's chest contents or drops, making them an excellent choice for shortcut (Shortcuts) quests or unlocking the Super Hot Watch (Super Hot Watch) . The Bullet's drawbacks are as notable as their perks: although Blasphemy clears bullets with every swing, it will only fire a piercing sword projectile when the Bullet has full health. Once the Bullet loses even one heart piece, they lose their only ranged attack and becomes limited to point-blank combat. Although clearing rooms in this manner is still possible due to Blasphemy's bullet-clearing effect, its damage is cut in half while its range becomes pitiful. Swinging the sword will also cause the Bullet to lunge forward slightly, so it isn't wise to carelessly swing around pits as you may accidentally lunge into one, chopping off some health. As a result, players will have to top off the Bullet's health as often as possible, or simply hoard armor (armor) to take advantage of Blasphemy's significant upsides. Additionally, Blasphemy's damage output drops the more floors the player completes (due to enemies and bosses gaining increased health), making the weapon more time-consuming and less effective as the run progresses. While Blasphemy is an impressive weapon, the Bullet's passive upsides do not offer much in comparison to the other Gungeoneers; they do not gain any form of universal gun improvement or ways to increase their ability to gain loot. However, Live Ammo makes contact-focused enemies completely harmless throughout a run, with Spent (Spent) , cube enemies like the Mountain Cube (Mountain Cube) , and most versions of Blobulon (Blobulon) essentially becoming Rubber Kin (Rubber Kin) . This also allows shotgun-type weapons to be used at close range without careless contact damage. Overall, the Bullet offers a non-traditional way to play through the Gungeon. Mastery of Blasphemy can easily allow the player to snowball through a run by collecting armor and keeping health maxed, and beat bullet-spam bosses more easily compared to other Gungeoneers. However, their upsides are largely based around their starter gun, making them less suited for players that focus on the Gungeon's wide array of firearms.",

    "text": "Title: The Bullet\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nNicknames that NPCs (NPCs) refer to the Bullet as include: Slug Ammo Round Shell Little guy Betrayer The Bullet's past and alternate costume are references to <u>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</u> (wikipedia:The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past) . The alternate costume is a reference to how Link turns into a rabbit if he goes into the Dark World without the Moon Pearl. The fact that a mirror is used to switch to this costume may also reference that Rabbit Link can only use one item in the Dark World, that being the Mirror. The victory screen card for the Bullet's past portrays the room where Link finds the Triforce, though with a few Gungeon-themed edits (and no Triforce). The Bullet's past is the only past which has more than one boss. The Bullet cannot access the Hall of Knowledge (Hall of Knowledge) because it is boarded off. When the Bullet dodge-rolls, the movement is similar to when a real bullet \"tumbles\". The Bullet is the only character story-wise that doesn't have a need to kill their past. Since they already have the true Blasphemy at the start of the game, it can be inferred that they have originally killed Cannon in the past, unless it was awakened by some other means. This is compounded by Agunim (Agunim) saying the player killed their master in the R&G Dept. (R&G Dept.) , even before you've killed the Bullet's past yourself. Since the Bullet only starts appearing after a different Gungeoneer's past has been killed, they may be making sure that Cannon is defeated or sealed, due to all the possible side-effects of changing history. Alternatively, some other now-fallen Bullet Kin may have been the one to defeat Cannon the first time, and the Bullet could be seeking their glory or infamy. This hypothetical second Bullet's death possibly explains why Blasphemy can also appear in chests, though not why a second Blasphemy exists. Interestingly, the physical Ammonomicon features a doodle of Cannon and the Lich (Lich) dueling, possibly implying that the Bullet failed to defeat him and the Lich had to step in to stop Cannon himself. The Bullet is immune to Blobulons (Blobulon) , Spents (Spent) , Tazies (Rubber Kin#Tazie) , and other contact damage-utilizing enemies due to Live Ammo (Live Ammo) . The Bullet deals 1 less damage with the Flame Hand (Flame Hand) than other characters, implying that they have a lower intelligence modifier, and therefore lower intelligence. The Cultist (The Cultist) will also get a wooden Blasphemy (Blasphemy) in The Bullet's past. In the final scene, a Coaler (Coaler) is holding the Really Special Lute (Really Special Lute) (a gun added in A Farewell To Arms (A Farewell To Arms) ), despite The Bullet's past being added in Supply Drop (Supply Drop Update) . The Bullet appears as an alternate skin for the playable Bullet Kin in the 2D platform brawler game . The Bullet's alternate costume causes them to hop instead of their normal walk animation. The Bullet is the only character with more than one alternate skin. The Shotgun Kin alternate skin was present in the files since the Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update (Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update) , but was only implemented when the physical edition was released. During character selection, selecting a character will cause their portrait to rotate, showing a bullet icon on the other side. The Bullet instead has a generic human silhouette on the other side of their portrait. If The Bullet's past is completed with their Shotgun Kin Alternate Skin, they will unlock both their Alternate Rabbit Skin and their Alternate Weapon Skin. While in flight using items, such as Wax Wings (Wax Wings) or Jetpack (Jetpack) , their cape changes shape to reflect this. Spinning your cursor around The Bullet quickly while moving will make The Bullet appear to be levitating, due to turning resetting the moving animation, which begins with The Bullet off the ground. If you beat the High Dragun with remaining armor, it will transfer to the past battle, making it potentially the easiest of all the characters.",

    "text": "Title: The Convict\nSection: Strategy\n\nStrategy\nThe Convict is a master when it comes to dealing high amounts of damage; however, this comes at the cost of having a lower effective range when compared to the other Gungeoneers. The Convict's main weapon, the Budget Revolver, only has a magazine size of 5 but comes with a fast fire rate. This forces The Convict to take on a more \"hit and run\" playstyle in the early game, quickly unloading onto an enemy and then pulling back behind cover to reload. The Sawed-Off is an incredibly powerful tool up close, able to deal with most first floor enemies with a shot or two. However, due to the spread of the gun, the damage quickly falls off the farther you are from the target and the range of the bullets themselves is very short. Wait for the enemy you are trying to kill to finish its attack cycle before walking up and firing; otherwise, you risk taking unnecessary damage. Luckily, whenever you take damage, you have the buff given by the Enraging Photo to work off of. The Enraging Photo not only provides a damage boost upon taking damage, but it also instantly reloads whatever weapon you are currently holding. Despite this buff, taking damage is usually detrimental, and intentionally hurting yourself to get the buff is not advised unless you know what you're doing. The automatic reload can make guns that have a special final shot (such as the Teapot (Teapot) , Mailbox (Mailbox) , and the Judge (The Judge) ) worse, as getting damaged means the clip will refill without giving you the final shot. The Convict's passive is not useful to more experienced players who can usually avoid taking damage, though it can be helpful during late game bosses like the Wallmonger (Wallmonger) , when the player should be constantly dealing damage out of fear of being crushed. Finally, The Convict's active is the extremely useful Molotov. When thrown, it sets a large area on fire, which can help clear rooms or damage bosses. The Molotov isn't consumed upon use and thus can be used multiple times throughout a run. However, keep note of exactly which enemies you are throwing it at. Flying enemies or those that are naturally immune to fire will not be damaged. The Molotov should normally not be used in small rooms, as there is a risk of you yourself getting caught in the flames, but if an item is found that gives fire resistance, feel free to use it when you see fit. Overall, the Convict is only very powerful when close to enemies, but has the Budget Revolver to fall back on should she need to attack from range. The Enraging Photo provides a powerful in-combat buff if she gets hit and the Molotov can be a powerful room clearer if used properly. However, given that her passive item and active item quickly fall off after the first or second floor, and that her starting weapons limit her to close range, she is often seen as the weakest of the Gungeoneers.",

Interesting to note, the Grey Cultist is fumbling with a pistol and bullet in their bosscard, rather than the normal Dart Gun (Dart Gun) and dart. The Cosmonaut was discovered in the original Enter the Gungeon release, implying that they and The Ninja (The Ninja) were likely cut or scrapped during development. The game's win and death screens call The Cosmonaut The Cultist (The Cultist) . The Cosmonaut's map icon is The Convict (The Convict) 's.

Upon opening a Chest (Chest) , the Cosmonaut will salute. Attempting to use the Jetpack (Jetpack) as the Cosmonaut will result in an odd sound playing and the item not properly activating. The Cosmonaut was probably based on a conspiracy theory called The Lost Cosmonauts or Phantom Cosmonauts. This theory holds that Soviet cosmonauts went to outer space before Yuri Gagarin and died in the process, but their existence has never been publicly acknowledged by either the Soviet or Russian space authorities. This is supported by the starting Cosmonaut gun the Makarov (Makarov) , which is based on the real life Russian firearm Pistolet Makarova (Makarov's Pistol), and by the Cosmonaut looking undead, as well as the Cosmonaut's nickname of \"comrade\". Due to what appears to be a skull in their helmet, there is a possibility that the Cosmonaut is based on the , a species of carnivorous beings from the British television show Doctor Who (wikipedia:Doctor_Who) , who at one point consume the Doctor's allies and uses their skeletons and space suits as puppets.

Synergies (Synergies) can be shared between players.

In addition to his renowned shooting skill, the Slinger was a powerful wizard who combined his two hobbies via arcane experiments in which he infused magic into the firearms of his fascination. Fearing that the ways of guns would replace the old magics, he retreated to the planet of Gunymede and constructed a grim fortress within which he could undertake his work. Beneath the fortress, he created a mine to extract black powder from the planet's crust for his experiments. In addition, he hired a family of gunsmiths to create weaponry for him to enchant.",

This leads into the events of , where the now paradox Gungeon begins to crumble. It is unknown what happened to the Gunslinger after he completed his mission.

Many weak guns are now much more powerful thanks to his passive, e.g. Cactus (Cactus) and Flare Gun (Flare Gun) , since these guns have many significant synergies. As a result, the strength of many guns is different for the Gunslinger compared to other Gungeoneers. It is especially beneficial for the Gunslinger to go to secret floors for more opportunities to pick up powerful weapons. The Shop (Shop) many times sells low quality guns that usually are not worth purchasing for other gungeoneers. However, the Gunslinger's passive can sometimes make them excellent options for a cheap price.",

    "text": "Title: The Gunslinger\nSection: Trivia\n\nTrivia\nThe Gunslinger has only one nickname that NPCs (NPCs) use: \"Slinger.\" Gunslinger was created on the side as art by Joe of Dodge Roll (Dodge Roll) while the other developers worked on the main game. The Gunslinger first appeared in the game files in the Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update (Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update) , but was not playable until the A Farewell to Arms update. The Gunslinger's appearance resembles that of Clint Eastwood in A Fistful of Dollars. Considering how the Lich resembles Lee Van Cleef's character in the movie The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, who serves as the antagonist of the same narrative universe, further connections between the Lich and the Gunslinger being the same, one being bad and the other good, can be made.  There is also a resemblance to Justice from Afro Samurai which ties in with the Number 2 being included in the game. It could also be a reference to . The cover shows a palace resembling the castle at the start of the game and the Gunslinger resembles the main character's design. The gunslinger may also be a reference to the character, Boss Godfrey in Cool hand Luke, due to being called \"the man with no eyes.\" in the film and also having impeccable aim. The time count shown at the end of the Gunslinger's unlocking run is the time of both runs combined. The poncho he wears seems to be alive, since it has a face on it which blinks during his idle animation. This, however, does not change any of the gameplay. This may be a reference to Dave of Dodge Roll (Dodge Roll) declaring on Twitter that , the Gunslinger wearing a \"mimic poncho\" would make even the player a \"mimic\" by proxy. When petting the dog the poncho will smile. According to the description of Slinger (Slinger) , he became known as the Gunslinger because he literally slings guns at his foes once they run out of ammo. His injured portrait during the Punchout fight with Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) shows his eyes to be Bullets, suggesting he has been using bullets as prosthetic eyes even before he became the Lich (Lich) . The Gunslinger lacks an animation for missing the Resourceful Rat with a left punch. Doing so will instead show a right punch. Unlike the other Gungeoneers (Gungeoneers) , the back of his character icon (seen when selecting a character in the Breach (the Breach) ) depicts a bullet resembling the Lich's skull. A special rendition of the Lich's battle theme is played during the fight with the Paradox Liches, making it the second soundtrack in the game to feature lyrics next to the main Enter the Gungeon theme. The Gungeon's appearance on the final screen of the Gunslinger's past seems to closely resemble that of a sword, possibly referencing one of Blockner (Blockner) 's quotes, \"The other dungeons me and Manny used to loot never had any guns. It was always sharp metal.\" This also potentially implies that the Gungeon used to possess an affinity towards melee weapons, rather than to guns. Blasphemy (Blasphemy) (wood version) could have been made (as a Pea Shooter (Pea Shooter) kind of sword, given to people when they got there) when the Gungeon favored melee weapons. This is unlikely, however, since dialogue in the Bullet's (The Bullet) Past implies that Blasphemy had its typical form before fading into the wooden form.",

    "text": "Title: The Hunter\nSection: Strategy\n\nStrategy\nThe Hunter starts out with the smallest loadout of all the Gungeoneers, having only 3 items to work with compared with the usual 4. However, the tools that The Hunter is given are strong enough for her to hold her own within the Gungeon's depths. The Hunter's main weapon, the Rusty Sidearm (Rusty Sidearm) , can best be described as average. It has decent damage, but with a mere 6 shots in a single magazine and slower bullets than most starting guns, it forces the Hunter to constantly be on the move. Arguably the best part about the Hunter is her secondary weapon, the Crossbow (Crossbow) . It's the strongest of the starting guns in terms of damage and can 1 or 2 shot every basic enemy on the first floor except for Gun Nut (Gun Nut) s, which take around 5. The extreme range provided by the Crossbow allows the Hunter to stay much farther away from enemies compared to other Gungeoneers and thus, take less damage on average. The Crossbow is also extremely ammo efficient to the point where it's quite possible for it to clear the majority of the first floor (including the boss) alone. The Dog (Dog) is the Hunter's only passive item, but it has the potential to be quite useful over the course of a run. Upon completion of a room, the Dog has a 5% chance to dig up a pickup. The pickup chance is completely separate from room rewards, so it's possible to get both at once. The pickups uncovered by the Dog can be coins, hearts, armor, blanks, keys, ammo and maps (Pickups) . Keep in mind that the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) will steal any armor and ammo left in the room, so they should be used/picked up immediately if they appear. The Dog (Dog) will also bark at Mimics (Mimic) , though this feature is less beneficial for more experienced players. Overall, The Hunter is an all-around solid Gungeoneer, as the Dog (Dog) is able to provide free resources, while the Crossbow (Crossbow) gives a viable alternative to the otherwise average Rusty Sidearm (Rusty Sidearm) until more powerful weapons are found. Due to this, the Hunter probably has the strongest early game of the 4 main Gungeoneers.",

    "text": "Title: The Marine\nSection: Strategy\n\nStrategy\nCompared to the other standard Gungeoneers, the Marine has the least variance in playstyle and is relatively reliable in performance.  He comes equipped with a piece of armor, which makes him slightly more durable than the rest of the characters.  His starting weapon, the Marine Sidearm, has a high clip size and fire rate combined with decent damage output and comparatively high accuracy with a quick reload, making it a viable weapon by itself for the entirety of the first floor and a useful backup even beyond. Military Training provides a notable increase in accuracy and decrease in reload times; provided the player can find weaponry to lend the trait to, it can vastly extend the effective range of some weapons and make some of the slower weapons more viable, particularly powerful bolt-action weapons such as the Hexagun (Hexagun) .  The increased accuracy can also make most shotguns much more effective at medium to long range, though it is recommended to stick to wider targets at these ranges nonetheless. Supply Drop, if kept until required, is a guaranteed ammo drop in emergencies if the player is low on ammo.  The downside is that the player is unlikely to need it until later floors; often, a better active item will drop beforehand and the player will be compelled to drop it or use it immediately.  However, more experienced players who are using elevator skips to later floors, particularly the third or beyond, may find the Supply Drop highly useful. It may also be sold to the Sell Creep if one is strapped for casings. Overall, The Marine is an extremely reliable character for combat, but while he receives a bonus to his gunplay, he lacks the special bonuses of other Gungeoneers, such as The Hunter (The Hunter) 's Dog (Dog) or the variety of boosts The Pilot (The Pilot) receives.  However, he remains a highly useful character for players with a steady aim, as his sidearm is easily the most powerful of the standard infinite-ammo weapons and his passive gives him an almost alarming propensity for chewing through rooms with some weapons.  He is best used if the player is looking to simply blast their way through the Gungeon, as other characters have bonuses that will help them with quests more.",

Furthermore, the Marine's starting armor is represented by his helmet during character selection, despite technically not being an item or a gun. The Marine's boss screen portrait is a reference to . The Marine's portrait weapon is a close homage to the Pulse Rifle from Aliens. When the Marine faces left, the scar on his right eye will change to his left as the sprite is flipped. The Marine's past and appearance are based on the DOOM (wikipedia:Doom (series)) series. In the pre-alpha, the Marine was called the Soldier. If in co-op during the past, the soldier in the ending cutscene will say “We're all still alive because of you... and your... little friend?” Posters of Black Stache (Black Stache) appear on certain walls in the marine's past. The Marine was considered for as a Bullet Kin clone, but he was scrapped. The Marine makes an appearance as a costume in . According to his artwork, the Marine is right-handed. The Marine's scar is not the same color consistently, as it is yellow on his sprite after losing his helmet, light brown on his old avatar, and red on the past-kill win screen. His right eye also is not consistent, being white on his old avatar but yellow on his win screen. The Marine's armor, at least in his normal costume, is actually not built very well, as the openings on his arms, right where a lot of veins are, could easily be targeted to make the Marine lose quite a lot of blood. Documents in the Marine's past reveal he'd been jailed for dereliction of duty (wikipedia:Dereliction_of_duty_in_American_law) when the Interdimensional Horror emerged, which he attributes to past cowardice.",

    "text": "Title: The Paradox\nSection: Notes\n\nNotes\nUntil the Gunslinger (Gunslinger) is unlocked, it is impossible to reach the Gun That Can Kill The Past with the Paradox. Although the entrance to Bullet Hell (Bullet Hell) will be closed, the Lich (Lich) will always grab the Paradox as they walk past and bring them to the next chamber unless Bullet Hell has not been unlocked by killing the past of the main 4 Gungeoneers. Once the Gunslinger is unlocked, the entrance to Bullet Hell is open as normal and the Gun That Can Kill The Past is accessible. However, if Bullet Hell has not been unlocked, then the Paradox is forced to end the run with the Gun That Can Kill The Past, as the Lich (Lich) will not pull the Paradox into Bullet Hell. The credits will show as if using the Gun That Can Kill The Past without the Bullet That Can Kill The Past (Bullet That Can Kill The Past) . The Paradox can also reach the Gun That Can Kill The Past during a Bless (Sorceress) run. This means that unlocking the Gunslinger is not possible during bless runs. The Paradox cannot take the Bullet That Can Kill The Past (Bullet That Can Kill The Past) . The Paradox can start with a starting weapon from a Gungeoneer that has not been unlocked yet, such as Robot's Right Hand (Robot's Right Hand) . It is also possible to get a weapon skin that has not been unlocked yet. In versions prior to v2.1.6 (v2.1.6) , The Paradox can start with the Old Crest (Old Crest) . In versions prior to v2.1.5 (v2.1.5) , The Paradox can start with the Bullet That Can Kill The Past (Bullet That Can Kill The Past) . Rifts can appear in Shortcuts (Shortcuts) . The Paradox is necessary to unlock The Gunslinger (The Gunslinger) . The Paradox's appearance changes to a random Gungeoneer and outfit every time they dodge-roll, flip a table, or roll a barrel. It is likely that the unused character Eevee (Eevee) was made to prototype this behavior. While forcing the game to select Paradox as a character through modded clients, the name Eevee itself is used in place of Paradox, which supports this theory. Sliding over a table does not change the appearance of The Paradox. If The Paradox picks up an item that changes their appearance (e.g. Clown Mask (Clown Mask) ), that appearance will be added to the pool of outfits they can change into. The Paradox uses the sprite of all other Gungeoneers with the same shadowy filter when fighting the Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) . If the Paradox has low health during the Resourceful Rat's third phase, their avatar will constantly \"glitch\" between all other Gungeoneer's avatars and a blue screen of death. The items the Paradox has are chosen when you select the character. You can check what guns they have in the Breach (the Breach) , but the item will not appear until the run starts. If you are given a cursed gun when selecting the Paradox, the curse animation will play over them while you are still in the Breach. Quick Restarting from the menu will start the new run as the player's selected default character if they don't have enough . Playing in Co-op (Co-op) will cause The Cultist (The Cultist) to have a randomized loadout different to the one The Paradox has. If doing a quick restart, The Cultist (The Cultist) and the Paradox will have identical loadouts. If The Paradox respawns with Clone (Clone) , they will not obtain another item. In v2.1.9 (v2.1.9) , it appears that they obtain another item, if Clone was the passive they started with. If the Bullet That Can Kill The Past is acquired through any means, such as cheating, it will still have no effect when the player uses the Gun That Can Kill The Past. If The Paradox spawns with the Gunknight Armor (Gunknight Armor) , Gunknight Helmet (Gunknight Helmet) , Gunknight Gauntlet (Gunknight Gauntlet) , or Gunknight Greaves (Gunknight Greaves) , The Paradox will start with two shields instead of one. This is because you obtain these items in the breach, which is chamber 0 in the game code. If you kill the Lich (Lich) while in Rainbow Mode (Rainbow Mode) , and you don't have Gunslinger (Gunslinger) unlocked, you will start as Gunslinger from the beginning to unlock them, but the Rainbow mode will still be active. Playing The Paradox with a blessing (Sorceress) will not carry over onto the Gunslinger (The Gunslinger) . Killing the Lich (Lich) as The Paradox without having unlocked Gunslinger (Gunslinger) does not count as an actual Lich kill, and will not add his respective entry to the Ammonomicon nor will it unlock his respective unlockables. It is unlikely but not impossible for The Paradox to spawn with a synergy between its gun and its item.",

    "text": "Title: The Paradox\nSection: Bugs\n\nBugs\nFor some unknown reason, for some players The Paradox might not even have the glitching effect when playing them, instead it will just roll through the Gungeoneers (Gungeoneers) and their alternate skins when rolling or interacting with something like usual. While playing as the Paradox, skipping a chamber can sometimes result in the Paradox not starting out with a passive item. In Co-op (Co-op) mode: If the Paradox drops their starter item and then dies, they'll be given another starter item, the same one they started out with. The Cultist (The Cultist) can pick up the duplicated starter items and possibly stack its power. Using the Save Button (Save Button) resets both players' loadouts. If either dies, they will respawn with a new starter item and weapon and drop their old ones. This enables one player to collect multiple starter guns. If either player dies while Riddle of Lead (Riddle of Lead) is in their loadout, their ghost's health will be restored by its healing effect. This makes them unable to be revived. If the other player dies, both players continue to play as a ghost at the same time. In this state the game cannot be lost but is very prone to becoming softlocked. If any of the players die with an item that increases heart containers, the killed player will never be revived. All chests that are opened from the remaining player will play the revival animation on them and recover their health. This can be fixed by saving and exiting to the next floor which will cause the killed player to be revived with less than full health, drop the item and sometimes their starting gun if killed again, and switch to a new starter item. This works if the killed player is the Paradox. If Macho Brace (Macho Brace) gets activated by a dodge roll, but a shot is not fired before the time limit, then the glow will not fade away (the actual damage increase will still disappear however). This can be fixed by activating Macho Brace again and firing a shot before the time limit. If you switch to The Paradox during a run using the Mod The Gungeon command console, you will not be charged credits to play the character. The screen will be all black apart from the gun, map, health, shells, keys, and blank GUIs. This can be fixed by pausing and returning to the game. The map icon and will not be changed. You will have to use the command 'character eevee (eevee) ' rather than 'character paradox'",

    "text": "Title: The Pilot\nSection: Strategy\n\nStrategy\nThe Pilot probably has the largest variance in performance when compared to the other Gungeoneers. His starting weapon, the Rogue Special, is the weakest among the main 4 due to its low damage, high reload times, large spread, and pitiful range. Furthermore, none of The Pilot's starting items provide direct in-combat buffs. This, combined with the lack of a secondary weapon, can make the beginning of runs quite difficult if The Pilot is unable to come across decent items. However, where The Pilot lacks in immediate power he makes up for in his ability to quickly amass resources. Trusty Lockpicks can be used on any locked object except for NPC cells and allow The Pilot access to rewards that other Gungeoneers would usually be denied. If you ever find yourself with no available keys and about to leave a floor with unopened chests or doors still on the map, there is no negative to using the Trusty Lockpicks in an attempt to unlock one of them. Though the Lockpicks can be used multiple times throughout a floor, it is quite dangerous to do so as it is always possible for a key to appear upon the completion of a later room or boss. Because of this, if the lock is destroyed, the chest that you could have now opened is cut off from you. If you find yourself in a position with 2 locked chests and 1 key, you should use the key on the more valuable chest and save the Lockpick for the other. If you have to choose between 2 locked chests but only have the Lockpick, use it on the more valuable one. The Pilot is the Gungeoneer of choice for runs aimed towards completing the Tinker (Shortcuts) 's and quests as the Trusty Lockpicks can potentially alleviate the handicap of being unable to buy items or open chests. Disarming Personality allows The Pilot to purchase items from any shop at a reduced cost which makes buying pickups much more forgiving. The Pilot's items also make retrieving the Prime Primer (Prime Primer) easier, as Trusty Lockpicks can make up for the inability to buy keys, and Disarming Personality lowers shop prices if you do need to buy something. Hidden Compartment (Hidden Compartment) provides 10% extra ammo with all guns, and can be incredibly powerful if The Pilot can get his hands on 2 active items. Hidden Compartment (Hidden Compartment) also makes the retrieval of the Arcane Gunpowder (Arcane Gunpowder) and Busted Television (Busted Television) easier as the items are considered actives and can be put in the second active slot if it isn't already occupied. Overall, The Pilot is more luck based than the other Gungeoneers simply due to the inconsistency of the Trusty Lockpicks. While he does start out quite weak, The Pilot can quickly become a powerful force due to Disarming Personality giving him more control over shop purchases and Hidden Compartment allowing for 2 Active Items. The Pilot is one of the most useful Gungeoneers for quests involving stockpiling Keys and Shells or transporting Active Items across floors.",

    "text": "Title: The Robot\nSection: Strategy\n\nStrategy\nThe Robot is a unique Gungeoneer due to its armor-as-health gimmick: it starts off with the equivalent of 3 heart containers worth of armor, and cannot gain health containers or pick up health at all. This has its own perks and drawbacks: on one hand, the armor gives the Robot a free blank effect every time it is hit, giving it instant breathing room and making it more likely for the player to find Secret Rooms (Secret Rooms) . It also negates the full heart of damage that jammed (jammed) enemies usually deal, allowing it to fare better during runs with high curse (curse) . On the other hand, armor is completely lost upon hit unlike hearts, and armor pieces are harder to find compared to heart pieces; this usually results in the player having to spend casings in the shop (shop) to recover hit points. This makes it likely for players to have insufficient funds for quests as the run progresses, such as those for shortcut (shortcut) s or the Resourceful Rat's Lair (Resourceful Rat's Lair) . Note that this has been fixed somewhat as of the Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update (Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update) , as any item that would usually give it a health upgrade (apart from the Master Round (Master Round) s, which grant one armor) will give a small amount of , making it slightly easier to purchase extra armor or other items. Due to the Robot technically having zero health, some items will work differently for it than for other Gungeoneers. For example, Riddle of Lead (Riddle of Lead) will always give it a 50% chance to negate damage, but Blasphemy (Blasphemy) will never shoot sword beams. The Robot also has another perk: every piece of Junk (Junk) gives it a small 5% damage increase. This turns a usually pointless item into a useful commodity, as chests that the player deems useless or unopenable can be destroyed and still grant the Robot's guns a gradual damage boost. Indeed, it is sometimes wiser to destroy chests (especially those of lower quality) in the hopes of getting Junk instead of purchasing a key to open it, as the money could then be used to purchase armor instead. This damage buff is especially useful due to the Robot's starter gun, the Robot's Right Hand (Robot's Right Hand) , which is commonly considered one of the best starting guns due to its dependable damage, firing speed and reload time, alongside its substantial clip size and accuracy; with enough junk, the Robot can sustain itself with just its starter weapon as a room clearer. Finally, Battery Bullets (Battery Bullets) gives all of the Robot's guns double accuracy and makes it completely immune to electrified water; Coolant Leak (Coolant Leak) also acts as a pseudo Molotov (Molotov) that the Robot can simply walk over with impunity while firing at enemies, and gives it guaranteed access to the fireplace secret in the first chamber (Keep of the Lead Lord) . Overall, the Robot is best used in the hands of players that can use its tools to the fullest capacity while being hit as little as possible: its strong starting gun, armor and junk gimmick are excellent tools that can substantially boost the Robot's effectiveness as the run progresses, though any lost hit points are likely to stack up against the player compared to the other Gungeoneers. It can essentially be considered a \"glass cannon\" of the playable characters, as it has many perks that can quickly turn sour if the user is careless.",

    "text": "Title: The Robot\nSection: Notes\n\nNotes\nIf Blasphemy (Blasphemy) is acquired as Robot, it will not fire projectiles as The Robot is technically never at full health. The Robot deals 1 more damage with the Flame Hand (Flame Hand) than other characters, implying it has a higher intelligence modifier and therefore, higher intelligence. Due to all non-rainbow chests being impossible to open in Rainbow Mode (Rainbow Mode) , it makes sense to destroy them instead. Besides the occasional pickup (Pickups) , this ends up giving you a lot of Junk (Junk) . Consequently, the Robot excels in completing rainbow mode, as the 5% damage boosts will build up over the entirety of your junking spree. Its relatively strong starter weapon also means the player can pick an item instead of a weapon on the first floor. The Robot's alternate costume is a Skeleton. The alternate style of Robot's Right Hand (Robot's Right Hand) is a skull. While using the robot's alternate skin, it is possible to fly by spinning and moving, as the game calculates falling based on when the character's sprite touches the ground. The Robot can't sell its health to the Vampire (Vampire) . As it technically has zero hearts, the Vampire will refuse to trade and say the Robot hungers as much as she does, a quote she tells other Gungeoneers at low health. Patches and Mendy (NPCs) are unable to heal the Robot, and to compensate will give it a Bottle (Bottle) , Armor (Armor) , or Junk (Junk) , for free. In Exit the Gungeon, if the Robot has less than 6 armor they will be restored to 6. It is unknown what will happen if they have more than 6 armor. Using a Peace Shrine (Shrines) as the Robot consumes the active gun with no benefit. As of A Farewell to Arms (A Farewell to Arms) update, the Robot can use shrines (shrines) that consume a heart container by losing two Armor (Armor) . Some effects from the Dice Shrine (Shrines) which affect health, like Bolstered, don't affect The Robot. The Robot cannot access the Hall of Knowledge (Hall of Knowledge) because it is boarded off. Unlike the other Gungeoneers, the robot falls into the Gungeon rather than descending down the staircase. If wearing its alternate costume, however, it enters normally. Spice (Spice) won't take any armor from The Robot, only giving curse (curse) and lower accuracy, making it a very powerful item. Unlike other characters, the armor given from a Master Round (Master Round) will not be removed upon dropping the Master Round. This allows The Robot access to the R&G Dept.

Prior to the Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update (Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update) , The Robot did not get from items that grant heart containers. The nickname \"Colonel Klink\" is possibly a reference to the old American television show, Hogan's Heroes (wikipedia:Hogan's_Heroes) , where Colonel Klink fits in the role of an oblivious colonel at a WWII camp. The nickname \"Number 4\" is possibly a reference to the movie Short Circuit (wikipedia:Short_Circuit_(1986_film)) , where the main character is named Number 5. The Robot's starting gun is called \"Robot's Right Hand\"; however, the art for the boss versus screen shows it readying its left hand, and not its right. This could be an implication that The Robot has swapped hands as to keep firing with its dominant hand, but is most likely just so that the rest of The Robot's body can be easily seen, as it would be covered by its right arm if it was instead extended. The Robot's past and alternate costume are references to the Terminator franchise (wikipedia:Terminator_(franchise)) . The minions summoned by the Last Human resemble the T-800 Terminators. The beginning of The Robot's past where it boots up is the same as the T-800 Terminator boot-up, with the red screen and systems activating. The soundtrack of The Robot's past is inspired by the Main Title theme of Terminator 2, the most famous theme of the franchise. EMP-R0R's appearance is a reference to Hal 9000 (wikipedia:HAL_9000) . The arena's walls are filled with references to various franchises and games including (but not limited to): A drawing of Mettaton from the game Undertale (wikipedia:Undertale) . \"Bots don't shiv\" is a reference to the phrase \"I don't shiv\" from Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (wikipedia:The_Dark_Knight_Returns) .

This is a reference to . Next to EMP-R0R stands a device resembling a hookah except with a plug, a reference to the act of \"jacking on\" from Futurama. EMP-R0R's pose and Roman styling may be a reference to Hedonismbot from Futurama. According to the Ammonomicon entry for Robot's Left Hand, the Robot, as well as most other robots, is left-handed. This is also signaled by Robot's Left Hand being much more powerful than Robot's Right Hand. The Robot's face is made of keyboard symbols. If the player some how manages to get up to where the EMP-ROR is, attempting to talk to it will result in it saying the Dialogue it normally says after killing the Last Human (The Last Human) .

Bullet Time is an active item. Contents 1\tEffects 2\tNotes 3\tTrivia 4\tSee also Effects Slows down time by 70% while active. The player's movement, firing and reload speeds are unaffected by the slowdown. Notes Synergy.png Bluer Guon Stone - If the player also has Blue Guon Stone, the size and rotation speed of the Guon Stone is increased and it rotates at a fixed distance from the player while they are moving instead of on a slight delay. If the Guon Stone blocks a bullet, it deals 15 damage to all nearby enemies. Synergy.png Thrown For A Bloop - If the player also has Blooper, while Bullet Time is active, a Blooper orbits the player and continually fires at enemies. Trivia The tagline \"Dodge This\" is a reference to a quote made by the character Trinity in The Matrix. \"Bullet Time\" is the name of the time-freezing camera technique popularized by The Matrix films, which later inspired the time-slowing \"Bullet Time\" mechanic in the Max Payne series of video games. Table Tech Time Statistics Type:\tPassive Ammonomicon Entry N/A N/A Table Tech Time is an unused passive item. Effects Slowed time when a table was flipped, similar to Table Tech Sight. Trivia It is unknown why this item was cut. Likely replaced by Hidden Tech Time. Super Hot Watch Statistics Type:\tPassive Quality:\t1S Quality Item.png Sell Creep Price:\t54 Money.png Unlock Method:\tCollect five Master Rounds in one run. Ammonomicon Entry Suuuuuuper Time moves as you do. This watch is extremely hot to the touch. Super Hot Watch is a passive item. Contents 1\tEffects 2\tNotes 3\tTrivia 4\tBugs 5\tSee also Effects Slows down time to 1/60 as long as the player is not moving. Essentially, 1 second normally becomes 1 minute when not moving. Notes While stationary, player actions will also be slowed down. As with other time slowing effects, this allows the player to fire far more quickly relative to the speed enemies act at. Dodging counts as moving and thus moves time forward. If you need to take cover from enemy fire, you can dodge into the cover so that time progresses forward. The five Master Rounds don't need to be different to unlock the Super Hot Watch. If a run is restarted using Clone, the redundant Master Rounds will count towards unlocking the item. Giving a Master Round to the Tinker will still count that round towards unlocking the item. The same will apply if a Master Round is given to the Sell Creep. The Super Hot Watch can be more easily unlocked in Boss Rush, as there are 3 chances to acquire each Master Round (excluding the 5th). If the player is sitting in a minecart, time will pass normally regardless of the player's movements, unless the player opens their map. Speedrun Mode's timer isn't affected by the item's effects. If the player enters gun switching mode, time moves slightly faster than it would if they were not moving. If you shoot Big Shotgun while immobile and use CTRL to rapidly switch between it and another weapon, you can fire Big Shotgun without expending ammo. The Shield of the Maiden is very ineffective with this accessory as you are immobile whilst using the Shield. The Tear Jerker has extreme negative synergy with this item, as standing still is often the only safe way to control your shots. Moving back and forth in short distances can help alleviate this, though this may be dispreferred or not plausible without taking damage in scenarios with many bullets on screen. The effect of the Super Hot Watch stacks with itself, meaning 2 watches will slow time down to 1/3600, or 1 hour for 1 second. Trivia UnusedSynergy.png Unused: - If the player has The Fat Line, it causes an unknown effect. This item is a reference to the game SUPERHOT, which constructs its entire gameplay around the same ability. The flavor text \"Suuuuuuper\" is a reference to SUPERHOT, where whenever a level is beaten a voice chants \"Suuuuuuper Hot\" on loop. Bugs Slowing time while using the Laser Rifle will cause the projectiles to disappear after crossing much less distance than normal, often even before reaching the intended target. Selling multiple items to the Sell Creep while time is slowed will only properly sell the first item dropped, with any other items simply staying on the ground and being unable to be picked up again. This can be avoided by unslowing time between each sell. Table Tech Sight Statistics Type:\tPassive Quality:\tD Quality Item.png Sell Creep Price:\t16 Money.png Ammonomicon Entry Flip Multiplier This ancient technique briefly increases gun output whenever a table is flipped. Chapter three of the \"Tabla Sutra.\" And in flipping the table, we are bettered. He who knows the table knows himself. Table Tech Sight is a passive item. Effects Flipping a table briefly slows down time and triples the player's shots for three seconds. Notes Synergy.png All Out Of Law - If the player has Colt 1851, it fires three tight spreads of three bullets upon reloading. These projectiles can ignore tables when fired from behind them, and they can reveal secret rooms without angering the shopkeeper Bello. Synergy.png Hidden Tech Time - If the player has Liquid Valkyrie or Bloody Eye, flipping a table briefly stops time. This only stops enemies currently on the screen, new ones spawning (e.g. by a Blobulon splitting) will not be stopped. Synergy.png Paperwork - If the player has Origuni, the first shot of every Origuni magazine fires three planes. If duplicates of this item are somehow obtained, further multiplies the player's shots. Sometimes flipping tables with duplicates may not activate time slowing down but shots still remain multiplied as usual. Hidden Tech Time Table Tech Sight + One of the following: Liquid Valkyrie.png Liquid Valkyrie\tBloody Eye.png Bloody Eye = Hidden Tech Time Flipping a table briefly stops time. Blue Guon Stone Statistics Type:\tPassive Quality:\tB Quality Item.png Sell Creep Price:\t30 Money.png Ammonomicon Entry On My Side Slows time upon receiving damage. The Blue Guon Stone, or the Stone of Critical Perception, increases its bearers reaction times in dangerous situations. Blue Guon Stone is a passive item and a Guon Stone. Contents 1\tEffects 2\tNotes 3\tTrivia 4\tSee also Effects Upon taking damage, decreases enemy shot speed by 33% for 5 seconds. Orbits the player, blocking enemy shots on contact. The stone orbits around the player faster than the other Guon Stones. Notes Synergy.png Bluer Guon Stone - If the player has +1 Bullets, Amulet of the Pit Lord, or Bullet Time, the size of the Guon Stone is increased, it rotates at a fixed distance from the player while they are moving instead of on a slight delay, and it rotates faster but orbits farther from the player. If the Guon Stone blocks a bullet, it deals 15 damage to all nearby enemies. This synergy is very effective against bosses, due to the large sprays of bullets most bosses fire. Synergy.png Tile Match - If the player also has Tetrominator, whenever the player shoots, Blue Guon Stone will occasionally shoot a J Tetromino. Since the Farewell to Arms update, the Blue Guon Stone now rotates twice as fast compared to other Guon Stones, and therefore no longer affects the location of other Guon Stones that orbit around the player. If duplicates of this item are somehow obtained, further decreases enemy's shot speed and adds another Blue Guon Stone to the player. Trivia The Blue Guon Stone, like all the other guon stones, is based on the Ioun Stones, popularized by Dungeons and Dragons. The tagline may be a reference to the idiom \"time is on my side\", as the item deals with the slowing of time. Bluer Guon Stone Blue Guon Stone + One of the following: +1 Bullets Bullet Time Amulet of the Pit Lord = Bluer Guon Stone Blue Guon Stone's size and rotation speed is increased. If Blue Guon Stone blocks a bullet, it deals 15 damage to all nearby enemies. Tile Match Tetrominator + One of the following: Blue Guon Stone Clear Guon Stone Green Guon Stone Orange Guon Stone Pink Guon Stone Red Guon Stone White Guon Stone = Tile Match When the player fires Tetrominator, each Guon Stone has a chance to shoot a Tetromino corresponding to the type of Guon Stone.",

    "text": "Title: Treadnaught\nSection: Strategy\n\nStrategy\nThe general strategy is to focus on taking down Tankers when they spawn and use the walls to provide some downtime while also letting it blow them up. Then, just kite around the entirety of the room and shoot it while avoiding his special attacks as they come out. If things get a bit too hairy, use a blank and immediately focus on any extra minions you see. To avoid its special attacks: Watch where the Tanker is landing and kill it instantly. Good ways to do this are a high fire rate gun or a full clip of pretty much any basic gun. Blowing up the pillars gives you more room to navigate around the room and lets you use long range weapons to hit his minions and the tank. Also, if you dodge roll (Dodge Roll (Move)) when you're about to be hit by this missile, it'll knock you back without damaging you. It may be beneficial to drop items that block bullets while remaining close to you, such as Sprun (Sprun) and Guon Stones (Guon Stones) , as they'll block the exploding bullet while it's close enough to you to damage you with its explosion, which can cause a very cheap hit. When you see it, just run sideways and you can dodge roll (Dodge Roll (Move)) for extra safety. When it gets relatively close, run diagonally from it and dodge roll at the same time. Side step or dodge roll through the small waves of bullets as they come towards you. When the large wave explodes, dodge roll over and towards it to easily avoid it. Note that all the special attacks are negated if destroyed with Blasphemy except for Minion Bullet. However, you need good timing to destroy the special bullets. Treadnaught is incapable of moving in diagonal directions, so putting a good amount of diagonal length between you and Treadnaught can increase the amount of time it takes for it to reach you.",

Turbo Mode will not speed up the past, making a faster past only possible with increased speed out of combat. If the player talks to Tonic with 5000 or more Hegemony Credits, he will extort 90% of the player's credits and buy a new yellow skin. When Turbo Mode is on, the floor map will have Tonic's head in the top-right. Despite Turbo Mode speeding up the game, certain aspects are not sped up. For instance, reload time and charge time will remain the usual speed. This may put the player at a disadvantage. The increase to the player's movement and dodge roll speed is greater than the increase to enemy bullet speed, but less than the increase to enemy movement speed. This makes it easier to outrun projectiles, but harder to outrun enemies that chase or run away from the player.

Turbo mode's increased speed also references Sonic's ability of speed and the fast-paced nature of his games. Tonic turning yellow also references Sonic's spines being yellow during his Super Sonic transformation, activated through obtaining all seven Chaos Emeralds. When the player completes Tonic's challenge, a golden statue of a chili dog will appear behind Tonic. This references Sonic's favorite food being chili dogs. Much of Turbo's dialogue, such as the line \"You're too slow!\", are quotes from Sonic the Hedgehog. Tonic's dialogue referring to his rival \"old robot Nick\" is a reference to Dr. Robotnik, also known as Eggman, the main antagonist of the games. However, Dr. Eggman would later get his own Gungeon-verse Expy in the form of Meowitzer (Meowitzer) . Tonic has unique dialogue for some YouTubers and streamers who play .

Reloading while standing still with the Super Hot Watch (Super Hot Watch) will stack the damage and size buff, allowing for incredible damage. Interestingly, the Turbo-Gun's bullets deal more damage at 2 reload attempts than 3 or 4; it is unknown if this is a bug or not. This can be useful for players wanting to get some benefit from the Gun's gimmick without excessive finger wear. Using Duct Tape (Duct Tape) and the reload ability of this gun will usually override the other guns' projectiles with this one's. While reload speed boosts (Reload Speed Boosts) may seem counterproductive, items such as Oiled Cylinder (Oiled Cylinder) are actually a net increase in DPS, provided the reload speed stays above 50%.

Sometimes getting even is all you've got left. You have been had. . . by the Resourceful Rat! Whatever was in that chest has already been taken by Gungeon's Most Wanted. This forbidden technique causes flipped tables to increase exponentially in mass, collapsing almost immediately. An apocryphal text of the \"Tabla Sutra.\" Of that which we cannot flip, we must pass over in silence. This forgotten technique causes flipped tables to gain sentience, however briefly. An apocryphal text of the \"Tabla Sutra.\" This ancient scroll invokes the tablegrammaton, the four letter name of table. Captures enemies and charms them upon release. Ancient monster trainers tried to use these balls to domesticate inhabitants of the Gungeon. According to local legend, Emmitt Calx threw one of these at a Beholster (Beholster) . It didn't work. However, it did force the beast to blink, which allowed Calx to escape. A transformative spell of incredible power. The wizard Alben Smallbore theorized that the more power was put into a spell, the less could be known about its outcome. This spell is immensely powerful. Shrinks and dazes enemies for a brief period of time. Said to contain the soul of a famous Gungeoneer. A hanger-on to the healthy and prosperous. Helps to navigate dangerous areas. In another era, this Raccoon was a very successful thief. However, after dabbling in time travel, he became obsessed and put an end to his thieving career in favor of the infinite treasure of the Gungeon. Greatly increases firepower. All equipped ammunition will shatter upon receiving damage. It takes an idiot to do cool things. That's why it's cool! An elegant weapon... though perhaps obsolete. Swordplay is forbidden, and only the most powerful or most ignorant individuals can get away with using any melee weaponry. Angers the Jammed. italics'' indicate that the effect is listed as the game's name for the effect, which is generally just a reminder.",

A video has been posted showing this tile set in action on a test floor (above image has a link to it).

That floor appears to have rooms mostly from the Hollow (Hollow) but ends with the Old King.

A test Gungeon flow still exists for this tile set. Although this flow is not functional with this tileset due to using rooms with pits which causes exceptions when the tileset was forced active via mods. (softlocks at load screen) The unused test Gungeon Flow spawns two Cacti objects in the starting chamber. They take about 2 shots from a gun to destroy and can't be destroyed by walking/rolling into them like most other scenery objects. Remnants of this tileset still exist in the current builds of the game. The \"canyon\" sections of the tileset are recolored and used as a placeholder tileset sprite collection for the Pilot's past. It is not normally seen by the player. However thanks to Nevernamed at YouTube, it was revealed by using the Drill on a chest in one of the Guneoneers pasts. That version of this tileset had the canyon tiles with a heavy purple tint to them with some change to the ground's color as well. All the pasts use this same place holder tileset. But it is unseen because special room prefabs are used to display the rooms instead of the normal tileset system. The old west doors are setup to close automatically when the player passes through them. They do not stay open like all other doors in the game. The only doors that do not exhibit this behavior with this tileset active is the doors to the Shop since this room uses its own set of doors.",

Note that the issues which have caused people to need this option in the past should be resolved now; as always, if you run into any issues let us know here on reddit or send us an email at * We've also restructured our asset storage and loading considerably; this shouldn't have any noticeable impact on gameplay, but does result in smaller patch sizes and a significantly smaller install size (on Windows, this was a drop from about 1.25 GB to 450 MB)",

This is further referenced in Exit the Gungeon (Exit the Gungeon) where Patches (Patches and Mendy) states that she went to medical school with someone who was a vampire. Her dialogue when the player declines the offer may be a reference to different blood types, positive and negative, or specifically B negative and B positive. It could also be a reference to Dota 2's character Bloodseeker, who also says a similar line. Her \"Do you believe in destiny [...]\" dialogue is a parody of a quote from Bram Stoker's . \"Life sucks, then you're jammed\" is a reference to the Albert Camus quote \"life is suffering, and then you die. Her dialogue upon unlocking her - \"I've crossed oceans of time to find this place\" - is also a reference to Bram Stoker's .

It is completely safe there, but you cannot see your character. The camera follows Wallmonger, which moves constantly, so downward movement may be required to get back in range. In Challenge Mode (Challenge Mode) , the Sniper Shells (Sniper Shell) atop Wallmonger are still able to fire at and damage the player in this state. If you have Live Ammo (Live Ammo) or any other item that prevents contact damage, the Wallmonger will still deal contact damage. Wallmonger can be slowed with items such as Triple Crossbow (Triple Crossbow) . Wallmonger can be stopped from moving by placing Portable Turret (Portable Turret) , which can also stop bullets. Wallmonger can be stopped with enough knockback, Disintegrator (Disintegrator) with Weird Science (Science Cannon) synergy provides 210 knock-back which is enough to cause Wallmonger to stop in place. If stopped in this way, it will barely shoot, making the fight very easy. Wallmonger can be stopped from moving if a chicken is placed in front of the boss. This won't stay for long since the chicken can be killed by the bullets from the boss. In order to do this, you must have Lament Configurum, a weapon that turns enemies to chickens, and have the wall coming toward you. You must have the Lament Configurum to activate and an enemy to appear in front of the wall. You must turn the enemy to a chicken before it gets left behind the wall or dies. If you're lucky and successful, the chicken would stop at the wall, giving you an advantage since bullets would take longer to hit you, the lava trial attack being much easier, and the wall being stuck. Note that your guns must be able to reach the wall since the camera would still go down. If you don't have a gun to reach the wall, you would have to die or be stuck in a softlock. This can also be done with the shadow clone item in a similar fashion. A softlock can occur if a freezing weapon such as the Crestfaller (Crestfaller) is used to kill Wallmonger; its death animation will be drastically slowed, and the player will not be able to move after it finishes. The item pedestal that spawns after defeating Wallmonger cannot be a Mimic (Mimic) , even if the player has the Mimic Tooth Necklace (Mimic Tooth Necklace) , because the pedestal spawns too close to Wallmonger. If receiving an item from a pedestal and the maximum number of items is already held, it is possible for the dropped item to bounce down under the dead wall, making it impossible to retrieve again.",

This is because both garments are directly inspired by the nameless drifter's garb from the film. Each Western Bro was to carry his own unique revolver, similarly to how Shades and Smiley both have their own ( Shades's Revolver (Shades's Revolver) and Smiley's Revolvers (Smiley's Revolver) ). While the precise names of the weapons are unknown, in keeping with the motif set by the Trigger Twins they can be safely assumed to have been called Angel's Revolver (Angel's Revolver) , Nome's Revolver (Nome's Revolver) , and Tuc's Revolver (Tuc's Revolver) .",

The player can pay Winchester to play his minigame, where the player gets four shots to break four targets. Depending on how well the player does, Winchester gives a chest (Chests) as a reward. The chest has a chance to spawn as a mimic; however, it is not affected by Mimic Tooth Necklace (Mimic Tooth Necklace) . While initially cold towards the player when met at the breach, Winchester seemingly warms up more with each trickshot challenge aced. Acing three of his minigames unlocks the Seven-Leaf Clover (Seven-Leaf Clover) . Obscuring the targets are arrangements of blocks, either moving or stationary. Your shots bounce off blue and green blocks (up to 4 times), but will be instantly swallowed up if they contact a red block. Furthermore, green blocks disappear after a shot bounces off them, allowing alternate paths to open up.",

Thus, the player will get no chest regardless of the number of targets hit. ** If the player switches to another gun, and then back to the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) , even if by accident, the player will only have one shot left, probably to discourage gun paths. * The effects of all gun-modifying items will work during the game, which can be exploited (e.g. firing more shots using Scattershot (Scattershot) ). ** For some reason, Backup Gun (Backup Gun) seems to cause the forward shot of the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) to be inaccurate. Additionally, on the final shot of the game, if the backward shot runs out of bounces before the forward shot, the game immediately ends regardless of whether or not the forward shot hit a target. It's recommended to drop the item in the room before speaking to Winchester to start the game, as once he has been paid, items cannot be dropped until the game is finished. ** Helix Bullets (Helix Bullets) will cause bullets to veer off-course; like Backup Gun, it is advised to drop the item before speaking to Winchester. ** If the player has Bloody 9mm (Bloody 9mm) , the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) bullet may be replaced with the Bloody 9mm bullet, potentially causing it to veer off-course. ** Most notably, Remote Bullets (Remote Bullets) can trivialize the game if possessed, and the game layout gives sufficient room for shots to be curved. * Gunboots (Gunboots) shots can destroy targets without counting against the four available shots. * If Duct Tape (Duct Tape) is used with the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) , it will have as many shots as there is ammo in the guns combined. * Using the Escape Rope (Escape Rope) will remove the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) from the player's inventory, making it impossible to destroy any targets or speak to Winchester again. * If playing in co-op (The Cultist) , dead players can block moving bricks using their body in the minigame, stopping them. * If the player leaves the room, they will lose the Prize Pistol (Prize Pistol) and no chest will spawn. * It is possible for Winchester to reward glitched or rainbow chests regardless of performance. * Ring of Triggers will still work with the prize pistol. * If the player has Heart of Ice (Heart of Ice) , falling in the pit area will trigger the damage effect, and destroy all of the targets. * If the player completes the game with bullets left in the prize pistol with the use of items (e.g Helix Bullets (Helix Bullets) )  the game will glitch and allow the player to strafe without use of the aiming stick allowing them to shoot in a different direction to their movement without the aiming stick. * If the player has the Magazine Rack (Magazine Rack) it will work during the minigame granting the player infinite ammo for the duration of the active item. * Using Shadow Clone (Shadow Clone) during the minigame spawns the clone with a prize pistol, it should be noted the clone's bullet will bounce more times than the player's, and is colored white instead of green.",

Astral Projections, as the main attack of the Wizbang is referred to by the Ammonomicon, are forms of 'out-of-body' experiences. This would explain why the projection resembles the Wizbang and why the Wizbang stays still while the projection is active. Their description as \"apostates\" of Gunjuration could be because astral projections are sort of a \"reverse summon\", projecting themselves somewhere instead of summoning other things to them, with Gunjuration being a play on the Conjuration school from Dungeons & Dragons (wikipedia:Magic_in_Dungeons_&_Dragons) . If a Wizbang is Jammed then the projection he summons will be dark green instead of bright red. Because of this it can be hard to notice the projection if the ground is dark. Despite this, the bullets it bursts into will be a normal Jammed colour. Blasphemy (Blasphemy) can destroy his projections. This doesn't damage him,",

This makes Unity especially effective with Wood Beam, as Unity's damage bonus will be multiplied by 2, 8, 16, or 26 depending on how fast the beam is swung. Wood Beam can reveal secret rooms, but it is ineffective at doing so, as it must be continuously fired at a wall for a long time before cracks begin to show.

    "text": "Title: 亵渎\nSection: 技巧\n\n技巧\n亵渎挥动时向前的后坐力可以被用来略微改变翻滚的方向，允许玩家在方向上达到更加精准的操作。 亵渎挥动的碰撞箱略微超过了玩家的背后，因此玩家在向前挥动亵渎时可以击中距离玩家十分近的身后的敌人。 亵渎的“装填”只在“装填”动画的最开始消除子弹，即使“亵渎”仍被举起在进行装填。 在满血时双击装填会触发一个带有装填条的更长的装填时间，这会有更多的时间来推开附近的敌人和消除弹幕。每挥动一次，可以有一次这样做的机会。 在“装填”时进入弹幕中不会消除弹幕 在贴着非常薄的墙时，面向墙挥动亵渎可以让剑气穿过墙，不过只有对于竖直的墙才是这样。 如果你挥动亵渎然后立刻翻滚，挥动产生的切口效果会与你一起移动，allowing you to slice through thicker walls of bullets or reach a farther away enemy. 如果你在挥动亵渎后快速绕你的角色旋转鼠标，你的挥动可以击中你身边的所有东西。 这允许你同时击中大量敌人或者同时消除你身边不同方向的弹幕。 A “guard flash” that hits nearly all enemies on screen regardless of distance or obstacles can be performed by swinging in the opposite direction of the enemies, then instantly double-tap “reloading” and quickly turning to face the enemies. This makes Blasphemy essentially a more powerful Camera (Camera) with slightly lower firerate, as the Camera only does 10 damage while Blasphemy does 14. The guard flash also gains the benefits of the double-tap reload, pushing back enemies and destroying nearby bullets. Guard flash can be performed with a normal reload, but it is very precise and difficult to do correctly. In versions prior to v2.1.4 (v2.1.4) , while using the carrot skin for Blasphemy, every sword swipe to the left functions as a guard flash without needing to perform one.",

Killithid (Killithid) ’s bullet portals can be destroyed with Blasphemy. Executioners (Shotgun Kin#Executioner) ’ bullet chains can be destroyed to ensure they do not hinder you. Cardinals (Bullet Kin#Cardinal) ’ homing bullets can be destroyed so that they are less of an annoyance. Gunjurers (Gunjurer) can be hit mid-teleport with Blasphemy. It is useful to hit Shotgun Kin (Shotgun Kin) again during their exploding death animation to destroy their death bullets. Creeches (Shotgun Kin#Creech) ’ bouncing bullets can all be destroyed by slicing the Creech as it is about to launch its attack. Shotgrubs (Shotgun Kin#Shotgrub) ’ bullets can be destroyed so they do not split. Professionals (Sniper Shell#Professional) ’ bullets can be destroyed so they do not split. Misfire Beast (Misfire Beast) 's whips cannot be destroyed with Blasphemy unless they are being fired. Skuskets (Skusket) ’ bullet lines and homing skulls can be destroyed with Blasphemy to render them harmless. Gigis (Gigi) ’ bullet eggs can be destroyed to prevent them from “hatching” into clouds of bullets. The blank-like effect created by the Bombshee (Bombshee) does not destroy slices. Any enemy that prepares bullets before firing them, like Bookllets (Bookllet) , can have them easily destroyed by Blasphemy before they can launch. Wizbangs (Wizbang) ’ projections can be destroyed with Blasphemy. Lore Gunjurers (Gunjurer#Lore%20Gunjurer) ’ bullet familiars can be destroyed with Blasphemy to negate all Lore Gunjurer’s power. It is safe to destroy Gunzookie (Gunzookie) or Gunzockie (Gunzookie#Gunzockie) bubbles with Blasphemy’s slice, as this will destroy the bubble and the bullet within. Chain Gunners (Gun Nut#Chain%20Gunner) ’ chain can be destroyed with Blasphemy, but it will return after a full rotation. Revolvenants (Revolvenant) ’ arms can be destroyed with Blasphemy to stop them from attacking for a while. Gunreapers (Gunreaper) ’ homing bullets can be destroyed with Blasphemy to make them less of an annoyance. Phaser Spiders (Phaser Spider) ’ web shots can all be destroyed with one slice if sliced at the base as they are fired. Shelletons (Shelleton) ’ laser attack can be canceled by hitting them with Blasphemy mid-attack. Fuselier (Fuselier) ’s lines of fire bullets and large cannonball bullet can be destroyed with Blasphemy. Blockner (Blockner) ’s shields can be destroyed to give more dodging room to the player. The Beholster (Beholster) ’s Beadie (Beadie) spawns through a projectile thrown by the Beholster. This projectile can be destroyed with Blasphemy to prevent the Beadie from spawning. Hitting the Beholster as it does its laser attack will cancel the attack, as the slice hits the base of the laser (which is recognized as a bullet by the game) and thereby destroys it. Blasphemy can be used to destroy Mine Flayer (Mine Flayer) ’s mines as he is throwing them. Treadnaught (Treadnaught) ’s special attacks can be destroyed with Blasphemy to render them ineffective. Attacks that are lines or walls of bullets like High Dragun (High Dragun) 's phase 2 attack are made easier with Blasphemy. Most attacks that attempt to restrict dodging area can be negated with Blasphemy. The High Dragun (High Dragun) 's RPG rocket can be destroyed with Blasphemy, and if you are standing in front of it, you will not be hit by the bullets as they only go outward in a forward-facing semicircle. The explosion from the rocket cannot hurt you. The Advanced Dragun (Advanced Dragun) 's grenades can also be destroyed with Blasphemy. The knives the Dragun throws can be destroyed mid-throw with one slice. Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) ’s mousetraps can be destroyed as he throws them as long as they are hit before they land. Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) ’s cheese summoning attack can be halved by destroying the full cheese once it has all reached him. Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) ’s crosshair attack can be negated by destroying the giant bullet as it lands. Resourceful Rat (Resourceful Rat) 's lasers can be negated by slicing the base of the lasers. Door Lord (Door Lord) 's laser attack can be stopped by slicing the base of the laser.",
